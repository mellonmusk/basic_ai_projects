<h3>※Namuwiki articles</h3>

- Web crawling using BeautifulSoup, used 2 main domains and 100 related articles for each main domain 

- Used namuwiki articles which are written in korean as source

- Then I made word clouds from collected data

- Attained similar words using Word2Vec

Note: I wrote this notebook in jupyter notebook, not colab. You would also need a file of shape that you want for wordcloud and a font file in your local environment.





<h3>※IMDB website movie review crawling</h3>

- Web crawling from dynamic website using selenium

- Collected reviews and ratings of John Wick4 from imdb

- Sentiment classification and rating prediction of movie reviews using Gemini & Huggingface (make sure to use colab T4 GPU)




<h3>※MovieLens 100K</h3>

- I used this dataset to recommend movies based on user profile


<h3>※Poet generator using Chatgpt API</h3>

- I used Chatgpt API and streamlit for this. Give a topic as input then it generates a poetry for you.
