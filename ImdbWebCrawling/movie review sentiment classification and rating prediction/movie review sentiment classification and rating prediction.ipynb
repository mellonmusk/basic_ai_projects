I can't believe how bad it was. If you like fighting scenes constantly and pretty much nothing else, then you may be fine with it. This movie was so boring that I got my phone in hand and started to play my games while listening to the movie for background noise. I am by the way doing this review while its still playing...lol! The first 3 were great and I've watched them like 3 times each over the years but this one, NOPE. Boring as can be. Gave it 3 stars cause they did a good job fighting and special fx were good.\",\n          \"3 scenes were the best action/fight scenes I have ever seen, and boy I have seen a lot!!\\n\\n3rd place: the stairs fight ... it was done perfectly ... cameras placement and rotation was just amazing ...\\n\\n2nd place: the Paris roundabout fight ... how did they think about this? I mean, the execution was simply unmatched ..\\n\\n1st place: the bird-eye view fight in the old building (the best angle of a fight scene I have ever seen), it was like a 2D game from the top .. like the ones we used to play on old consoles but with today's technology, I have to say that this is the best way I have seen to shoot a fight scene!!\\n\\nA perfect finale ... amazing job!!\",\n          \"I really liked the first 3. And really hated this one. I thought the action sequences were stupid like one that reminded me of the scene in Hot Rod where Andy Samberg goes flying down and a hill and doesn't stop for miles. Apparently this is one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation. There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that I liked but I can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One.

We are firmly in pretty mindless action that stands apart in the way things are shot and the other production aspects.

It was a nice, simple, tight story with *great* action sequences that worked really well and revitalized a genre in a way we haven't really seen since Die Hard. The sequel was mostly more of the same but because they could smell the money making potential if they managed to turn this into a major franchise they started to layer on some more world-building details and lore. I didn't like it as much as the first movie but it was still good fun. The third movie is where this franchise started to lose me - sure, the action was still great for the most part, but the believability was starting to slip a little and all the lore they kept adding was beginning to feel more than a little absurd. Now, with this fourth movie... I'm really starting to think the writers just love the smell of their own farts. This franchise is so far up it's own... *ahem* posterior - that I don't think they can even see where they're going next. The action sequences are still very well choreographed and look great - but action sequences alone do not a movie make.\n",

I don't have to sit through a bad movie because i paid for it) or...turning it off. And the reviews were right. I lasted almost forty minutes for this one. I COULD say, 'maybe it's because i'm old', that THAT's why an empty movie like this franchise churns out doesn't appeal to me...and many rave reviewers here wrote about 'the action...the action...the action'. But, as far as I'M concerned, even THAT was ridiculous....unless Wick lives on a lead diet, because in the last scene i watched, where he's on his way out of the Osaka Continental, someone missed him at close range(like 2 feet away, tops?) with an automatic rifle spitting out who KNOWS how many rounds a second? Please. With all the money that's pumped into a movie like this, they SHOULD be able to do better. Yes. The locations were beautifully filmed, hence the two stars. But i really question the mentality of anyone who would want to see this ridiculous excuse for a 'GREAT...the BEST...the absolute BEST' action adventure...by the way...did you like that imitation?\n",

      "Review: John Wick Chapter 4, the latest installment in the action-packed franchise, sadly fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. While the series has always been known for its relentless action and stylish cinematography, this particular entry falls short in several key areas, leaving fans and audiences feeling unsatisfied.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the major flaws of John Wick Chapter 4 is its excessive nature. While the previous films struck a fine balance between thrilling action sequences and a compelling narrative, this installment seems to have prioritized mindless violence over meaningful storytelling. The film bombards viewers with an overwhelming amount of action, to the point where it becomes tedious and numbing rather than exciting. The absence of a well-structured plot is keenly felt, and it's disappointing to see the movie rely solely on its action sequences without offering substantial character development or engaging dialogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the film suffers from a lack of innovation and fresh ideas. The franchise has always prided itself on pushing the boundaries of action cinema, but John Wick Chapter 4 feels like a rehash of familiar themes and set pieces. The choreography, while undoubtedly impressive, lacks the innovation and creativity that made the previous films stand out. It becomes apparent that the filmmakers have relied too heavily on the formula that worked in the past, resulting in a stagnant and repetitive experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue with this installment is the overwhelming presence of gratuitous violence. While violence has always been a part of the John Wick series, Chapter 4 takes it to an extreme level that becomes tiresome. The constant barrage of brutal and gory scenes can be off-putting and may alienate viewers who seek more substance and depth from the film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its shortcomings, John Wick Chapter 4 does have its moments. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a committed performance as the titular character, showcasing his physical prowess and charisma. The film also features some visually stunning moments, thanks to the talented cinematography team. However, these positives are overshadowed by the film's lack of a compelling narrative and excessive reliance on mindless violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, John Wick Chapter 4 disappoints as it fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors. The excessive action, lack of originality, and gratuitous violence detract from what could have been another thrilling entry in the franchise. Die-hard fans may still find enjoyment in the film, primarily due to Keanu Reeves' performance, but for those seeking a well-rounded and compelling cinematic experience, this installment falls short.\n",

      "Review: John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it.\n",

      "Review: Overall a decent yet deeply flawed and the weakest entry in the franchise. An utterly unnecessary and bloated running time with slow pacing storytelling that bored the crap out of me. The admittedly jaw-dropping and creatively impressive action sequences grind on for so long that they become borderline tedious. This one had too much style but not enough substance, courtesy of the convoluted screenplay and messy direction. Also I didn't liked some of the performances, especially Bill Skarsgård, because he didn't had any character development and his accent was off-putting. The stunt they pulled with that outrageous post-credits scene is like a middle finger to the audience. There better be a follow-up in the sequel.\n",

The fight scenes were so cool especially the shotgun dragons breath scene where the camera is looking down into the building and follows Wick from above as he lays waste lol. It was a little bit dragged out though. I liked it don't get me Wrong but I think it would've worked completely fine had it be 2hrs30mins in runtime. Some of the fight scenes give you a beat to relax then start back up. The whole Osaka Continental fight scene was so cool with the arrows. Donnie Yen is a beast too. Especially in the Osaka scene. My only gripe with the film, which I understand at Keanus age and stunts can be taxing, is him phoning in his performance. Even with the first Wick film he was more animated. Especially in his movies before then. Like look at the first matrix even and then put his performance here aside it. You'll see he had more emotion back then. Yeah you can say it's \"the character\" but even with the latest Bill and Ted as well as Matrix 4, he seemed to be phoning them in as well. So idk but regardless I would see this movie in theaters. IMAX would be best.\n",

Titular outcast assassin Keanu Reeves clunks thru an interminable 3hr series of laughably implausible fight sequences (aided by the likes of Lawrence Fishburne & Ian McShane) to get to an ultimate showdown (set by Clancy Brown) with global crime syndicate lead representative Bill Skarsgård (good) - and aside from the odd change of allegiance, that's it.

      "Review: Given the sad state of Hollywood output these days, this is one of the better offerings. But it does require some suspension of disbelief. You have to believe that 58 year old 175 lb Reeves is a dangerous man. And that sorta works. You also have to believe that this franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-retirement from Asian films was really a good idea? And the writers have stolen tropes and tricks from a handful of prior productions including KUNG FU (wise sayings); MY NAME IS NOBODY; VANISHING POINT (radio overlay); THE BLIND SWORDSMAN; THE GAUNTLET; and of course the first 3 movies in the series. The one quote that best applies here was left out of the script -- \"in the realm of the blind, the one-eyed man is King\".

If that sounds like a fun time, this is the film for you. Don't overthink this chapter of the story or this franchise. This is about Keanu Reeves beating and shooting everyone in his path.

It was like watching someone play a shoot-em-up video game and you know how boring that is to watch. It was exactly the same. Even a couple of the fight scenes looked like something off Tekken (people dancing in the background) and the top down view was also reminiscent of a video game.

      "Review: Watching this film is like drinking a fine wine that tastes like a spicy Bloody Mary. The impressive feat of the fourth film of a film franchise being this good is unheard of. Not only is it good, it may be the best one yet. Everything that I loved in the first three films are brought here, but the story and layers is so deep, the characters are legitimately compelling. The stakes keep getting raised, the tension tightens as the films progress. Violence is still just as brutal as the first. I'm feeling emotional towards some of the characters outside of John Wick which means the side characters are really good. And yet all of this began after a foolish child killed Wick's dog. However at this point, it's gone beyond just a revenge tale. Now, it's all about survival, the insurmountable obstacles John Wick has to endure to achieve ultimate redemption and finally peace. That's why these films work, because we are all still routing for Wick to make it through and maybe find solace. With that said, the things that also work have to do with Stahelski's amazing direction for someone who was a stuntman is very impressive. Reeves has embedded this character into his own being so much it's now so iconic for him much like what Indiana Jones did for Harrison Ford. Donnie Yen comes in and steals all the scenes he's in, and a great addition to the Wick franchise, creating even more possibilities of where this can go. Clancy Brown makes a welcomed appearance and make the most of his screen time like the true veteran actor he is. Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne complete the cast of solid side characters and both give great performances in this as well. The only reason why this has an 8/10 is because of the runtime. The other films were short and sweet and were effective without the long runtime. This did feel like it dragged on at parts. Nothing that derailed the whole thing or anything, but broke some of the momentum the film built up but luckily the great scenes brought me right back. I'd also like to pay my condolences to Lance Reddick who passed away way too soon. I will remember him for his great scene in the first John Wick film, and he will be missed.\n",

      "Review: The John Wick Franchise has changed and evolved throughout the years but the 4th installment in the series beats it's predecessors in literally every possible way. John Wick Chapter 4 combines all the components of its predecessors, but better. It delivers staggeringly choreographed action sequences, a mesmerizing climax with such visual and auditory style that it has set up new standards for action films moving forward. The characters were all pretty interesting and enjoyable with Keanu Reeves and Donnie Yen particularly killing it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story was mostly well written and pretty well thought out which at times feels like a video game quest. Though the film's nearly 3 hour runtime can drag a bit but it's easily excusable with so many other great stuff happening on screen.\n",

And all the characters are there along with the whole host of new characters that spice up the stories, inside the story. There are some chuckles when you need them the most so you can exhale and take a fresh breath scattered throughout the film. Oh yea stay until the end of the credits!! Enjoy.\n",

      "\n",
      "However the action is ultimately what it's all been about as one is left with a myriad of questions into the mythology and other characters from 2 & 3 that leave some people like myself with some frustration.\n",
      "\n",
      "My primary question in 3, is that after 2 there was tremendous significance placed on the marker with equal emphasis on the infallibility of the High Table.\n",
      "\n",
      "You have Sontino D'antonio utilizing a marker to eliminate his sister who is member of the high table. You have Winston keeping a ledger of the marker...\n",
      "\n",
      "Now there is nothing in 3 definitely not 4 that resolves this issue leaving the viewer to come up with their own hypothesis to fit into the events.\n",
      "\n",
      "The high Table not the Gamorah come after John after Santino is deservedly slain- yet he is rewarded for sanctioning the hit on his sister? We know a record of markers and currencies are part of the neutral ground and sanctuaries of the continental chain of hotels. One wonders why Winston did not bring this up during his adjudication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Possibly-The high table perhaps then saw her assassination as an internal dispute as to who should be at the seat belonging to them but why would that justify Sontino taking out a 7 million dollar contract on Wick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps since Santino was killed without an order it is viewed differently the contract is out of territories belonging to that family and is seen as disrespectful to the table. It's a tight fit but grants it coherence. If approached more strategically perhaps Mr Wick could have had the Santino bounty removed and left him to be dealt with on the level of the table. Taking his rightful anger out and doing so in the continental does threaten the structure. For the type of film I can be fine with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after three you're left to wonder what's the deal with Angelica Houston & Halle Berry. Halle Berry I assume is pardoned at the outset because of the marker, Her old boss may be under no obligation to kill him but it's his discretion ok... but then she creates her own problem by having her dog attack him, and she blows his knee cap what's her status?\n",
      "\n",
      "At the opening of this film one assumes that the previous elder is deposed for underestimating or misreading John, and perhaps being unaware of the amount of influence Winston has over John leading to a debacle. One can assume the adjudicator is dealt with as the concierge and Winston were.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of three one assumes the \"Bowery King\" though operating more independently still cannot defy the table...would be the mastermind for John Wick but he's not very involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why this Marquis guy the one to take charge- why does his #2 speak Spanish not French- and what accent is the Marquis using because it's a terrible French.\n",
      "\n",
      "The open contract has competition killing each other for 25 million making John's chance of survival more realistic. Not very logical in terms of the Table unless they're sadistic power players pitting underlings against each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's true that John is \"addicted to the vengeance\" is a man with nothing to lose, and once Helen died if not his dog or car unless he met another would have found some other reason to relapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "If John wanted to survive he merely could have disappeared after falling off the roof....he didn't go for Winston nor does it indicate that he planned on it and that would have been the only unsettled score for John.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking on the Table was motivated by Winston. Continuing after the roof could be a debt to the Bowery King for saving his life and getting him back to health maybe or just John's own death wish but with a desire to destroy the establishment in doing so.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dialogue exchanges in the first three were significantly more entertaining than in this installment outside of the card game in Berlin.\n",
      "\n",
      "What this movie had over the third was the cinematography and scenery. This installment was designed to be appreciated from an IMAX screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's clear 30 minutes in that the \"story\" really ended at the end of Chapter three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Had they made the \"Resistance\" and Laurence Fishburne more integral, it might have given the film more substance.\n",
      "\n",
      "This movie should be \"The Finalization of the Table\" because it was about John from their perspective not from his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was frustrated having to wait for a fourth they didn't turn it into Alien or Rocky thank goodness, but waiting 3.5 years for what was purely a visual wonder. Excellent choreography music etc... but the characters and story were pretty much completed in Chapter 3. The dialogue was repetitive since the fist film.. \"We're both damned\".....\"Thinking you can change who you are & lying to yourself\" etc....\n",
      "\n",
      "Every dialogue sequence in Parabellum was significantly better from \"Tick tock Mr Wick\"....to \"How can one burry the Ocean\"......\"You gave John Wick 7 bullets your punishment is seven cuts\".... \"John...your exhausted, tired, clearly in pain and you still killed all my students...If I didn't have to kill you we could be friends\"...That was primarily what I found missing from this final istallment... outside of exchanges in Osaka & the Berlin Card game, you didn't have sufficient satisfying breaks to not feel that the final action sequence was tiring.\n",

I wish I could recommend the movie, but I can't. I haven't seen the rest of the franchise movies, but will have to check out the first one as they tend to be the best and sequels tend to get steadily worse. So if you're looking to watch mindless action and violence, then this movie will be for you.\n",

Plot is weak, the film is really just a sequence of very long drawn out and unrealistic fight setpieces....which nevertheless are well shot. Unrealistic because the skill with which every single fighter in the movie (and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them) can dodge bullets is ridiculous. Suffice to say, the ratio of gunshots on target at close range (within 1-2 metres) is about 1 in 10. Either the fighters are impossibly good at dodging bullets or else they have become so adept at unarmed combat that their gun firing skills have become nonexistent.\n",

It feels more like a video game for teens where you need to kill 500 people than an action movie. Not sure why some people rate this so high and give it a 9/8. Maybe the grand locations and the beautiful settings, including the massive club in Berlin are amazing, but the way the movie is told is kind of disrespectful to viewers.

      "Wrong. Unfortunately. I don't want to go into the potholes, because this is not a documentary or a drama, so let me cut it some slack there right away. However, even with that headstart, things are going downhill quickly.\n",

      "This is the first time when I have seen John Wick tired, weak or worn. Some of the action scenes look really silly because there is no perceivable force or momentum in John's moves.

      "Then the so-much cited world-building...oh well, we needed that as much as a mole needs sunglasses, but still: where did it derail so badly? I mean this is supposed to be a secret society, operating behind the scenes, barely leaving a trace, right? Then how come that armies (literally, small armies, plural) of assassins and henchmen are just swarming in world-famous locations, time after time? How come that there is apparently a \"Continental\" in every major city? That there is always yet another rule, which can be used to move the \"plot\" (man that was difficult to label it such) forward? If you bend the rules (your rules, btw) so many times, why would anyone invest into the characters? If they get in a pickle with seemingly no way out, we just invent another rule (or exception, or amendment, or whatever), and the job's done. It really turns any dramatic potential (not that there are many to start with) into a proper snoozefest.\n",

      "OK, so not much substance or plot, Mr Wick is not who he once was, and the world building sucks....but the action scenes are still great, right? Well, kind of. Clearly not my taste, but it is evident that a lot of effort went into creating them, so I can perfectly understand if some of the viewers find them enjoyable. For me, they just went waaay to far. There are so many opponents executed (hundreds, literally), that there is no weight to it. No matter what, the bad guys drop, and John Wick walks away...gets boring after the first 150 killings or so. The complete lack of realism doesn't help, and neither does the fact that they overwrite their own set of rules in an instant if and when they deem fit (example: you can't penetrate the magic armor by bullets, but apparently you can cut and stab through it....come on now, decide already).\n",
      "\n",
      "With all that being said, the movie does have its moments...few and far in between, yes, but still, sometimes it just does. That however doesn't justify the 3 hours I feel I have wasted watching it: I would have needed a lot more meat on the bone, some better characters, at least a bit of a reasonable plot, and some consistency at least against its own set of rules.

Honestly, even though I enjoyed them, there were way too many (and too long) fight sequences in this film that didn't jive well w the bland story line!

Too many characters, too many rules/norms/High-table bs, too many bullet sponge cartoonish mob fight, indestructible superhumans and John Wick himself being a cardboard cut-out parody version of himself. I mean yeah it has some cool actions scenes, especially the Hotline-Miami esque topdown shooting sequence and almost every scene with Donnie Yen but does it erase all the overkills? What made the first 2 films so great was that JOHN WICK actually felt like a human, had emotions. Now its just using the suit as a shield and walk away with literally anything. Also for a movie with action legends like SANADA-SAN, DONNIE YEN, KEANU REEVES there was barely any worthwhile action, I just wanted a showdown with each of them in their prime but the movie infuriatingly shies away from that.

There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.\n",

Imagine going into a club, knifing, shooting or axing 50 people on the dance floor... Yet everybody keeps dancing. Or shooting 50 assassins and destroying 20 cars or the roundabout of the Arc de Triomphe... Yet no police shows up and everybody keeps driving as if there is nothing wrong. That roundabout has troubles digesting normal traffic that don't need to worry about dodging cars, bullets and brain from all of the head-shots.

Look where we started with original John Wick and where we ended up now. From a good story, rough, dark, believable John Wick, we gradually got another, sorta Marvel, ridiculousness, from everyone wearing \"batman suits\", blind ninja, desert chase on horses, while still wearing same clothes. Yes, this is an action movie, and there's shootings and fights and killings, but it's gotta be proportionate to everything else, no?

      "Review: I watched this latest installment of the John Wick killing spree over two nights. I usually don't do that kind of thing, but this movie is rather exhausting. In the old days, they had intermissions in the middle of long movies. But now we're expected to sit through nearly three hours of endless murders. I'm not sure what I was expecting to be different in this one. I liked the first two Wick movies. The third one was less memorable (I had to watch a YouTube summary video of the series to remind myself what had happened in 3) but it was still enjoyable. This one is basically more of the same. John Wick once again has to deal with some euro trash second rate Bond villains in order to regain his \"freedom\". To obtain said freedom, he kills about 250 guys. Maybe more. I lost count. The director stages lots of beautiful backdrops for John to kill people. He kills them in neon drenched Osaka. He kills them in a very wet Berlin rave. He kills a whole bunch in Paris, the city of light, and the city without a single police officer in sight. I know these movies are just ultra violent fantasies, but at a certain point during one of the many parts of John Wick's Paris bloodbath, I felt like I was watching a video game. I'm sitting there watching all this money being spent... so I can feel like I'm watching a video game. Somehow I feel that wasn't the director's intention.\n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of the addition of the wonderful Donnie Yen (again playing a blind swordsman) and some often incredible production design, JW4 is not the masterpiece that some are claiming it to be. The main problem in all of these movies is, even if John Wick gets his freedom, what would he do with it? Work at Home Depot so he could moonlight as The Equalizer like Denzel? There isn't really anything at stake. There never was, I suppose, but somehow I didn't feel it as much in the other movies. But I definitely felt it in this one. Man, I'm tired of John Wick.

      "Review: First of let's just get this out of the way, the action is great in this movie. It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all. I truly hope this was studio pressure, and that Stahelski releases a director's cut to remedy this. I can only assume there's dialog and complex choreography that were cut in lieu of the popcorn stuff.\n",

      "What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like \"City Of Lost Children\" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.\n",

      "Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.\n",

It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly.

The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Then there's the blatant plagerism of Walter Hill's, The Warriors which demonstrates just how little new the franchise has to offer. Time to call it a day.\n",

The gun trick at the end was really obvious, like how would that person not realize John didn't fire? The sound editing and the angle of the camera make it very easy to see all this. I do not get why this is getting rated higher than other Wick movies. One was small budget and really clever and tight, and 2 was bigger and more action but still realistic. 3 gets a little more absurd but by the stair scene in the 4th movie it's like a DC movie because it's too dark for marvel.\n",

And of course everyone has a weapon, whole Paris is armed, this is the model. And wait, it's all guys fighting and shooting.

Stop associating weapons with manhood and power and the mains to solve problems. Just stop it. The Wild West had ended. It's 2023.

I saw the nods to the Matrix in a few scenes (the rain scene and the subway scene) which was interesting but I'm telling you the fight scenes were yawnworthy. The storyline was weak too . . . I thought he was going to take on the twelve but not only did he not do that but we are left with almost no knowledge about the 12. I would have liked to do more of a deep dive on that subject . . . Surely we could have investigated that more deeply in the THREE HOURS?? Keanu's movements are also getting too slow and deliberate. In a way I think that's why they ended his story . . . He probably wanted out. It was great to see Laurence Fishburne again since they snubbed him in the last Matrix movie but I would have liked to see more of a deep dive with his character.

      "Review: I thought the previous John Wick movies were just a bit over the top with all the fighting but this latest one takes the cake. I watched the first hour, praying silently: Please let the fighting stop for a moment and give me a bit of a story instead! To no avail! If you love lots of martial art and mass killings of bad as well as good guys every minute of this movie then you will love it. In my eyes it is a parody of all the action movies ever made. A blind former friend doing incredible damage by sound alone. Really? John Wick miraculously escaping all the firing of automatic weapons pointed at him? From five feet away? The only realistic scenes in the whole movie are the ones where our hero actually has to reload his gun periodically. First time I've seen that in an action movie. So make it two stars instead of one! Just kidding! Summing up, if you like to see unbroken action containing martial arts, combined with automatic weapons you will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for good action movies, watch the \"Die Hard\" series again!\n",

      "Review: This by itself is a pretty decent movie not as good as Chapter 2 but about as good as the other 2. However, the impression that I get from the first 3 John Wick movies is that he doesn't die and is incredibly skilled. In this though he dies after getting shot 3 times which he survives similar things in the other movies. Because of this it just feels like it was rushed and just missed the point of the rest of the franchise. The CGI was unimpressive but the last time I watched a new film it was Avatar: The Way Of Water so it might just be my expectations being set too high. On the bright side the extras were much better than in the previous films.\n",

      "Review: I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.\n",

      "A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?\n",

Donnie Yen's character Caine is probably the best character the franchise has introduced besides Wick himself. This movie does a great job of expanding on John's more emotional arc. John realizing that the freedom he wants isn't going to be fulfilling and that he has the opportunity to give the life he wanted to Caine is great storytelling, and is elevated by Keanu Reeves' layered performance. John's sacrifice is great and I think they did a perfect job sending the character off. On top of the amazing writing and action, the directing is amazing and the cinematography is the best in the franchise. 9/10.\n",

Anti-cerebral trash for the simple minded. If you watch the first 15 minutes, you've seen all you need to see. Best part was driving home with my adult son and laughing at how stupid everything was.

Anyone who is a gamer and a film buff knows what I'm talking about. In John Wick: Chapter 4 it felt like more of the same.\n",

I really looking forward to seeing this movie, I did not watch any trailer, did not read any article to be max. Surprised and I was. Sadly, very sadly, not in the positive way.

The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all... To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable 😂).\n",

      "Review: So you know where I'm coming from, the John Wick series is a kinda guilty pleasure for me. The first one impressed me with the Red Circle club's joyful murder-set-to-dance music scene, and I loved the mythic, supernatural world of assassins in the Continental Hotel. In John Wick 2 and John Wick 3, that mythical assassin world got expanded, and I loved it. There were inventive fight scenes that were fun to watch, and these increased with each installment. The dialogue was cryptic but interesting to listen to, and even Wick's briefest opponents during fights had distinctive features to them that made them memorable.\n",
      "\n",
      "But John Wick 4 is a giant dropoff in quality. The characters are dull (Donnie Yen is a charisma black hole, as well as an african american actor called \"The Tracker\" who cannot act for his life, and is apprently there as a condescending \"he has a dog like John Wick, so you must like him\" ploy) and even Keanu's laconic delivery is lifeless. Natalia Tena is the one bright spot, playing Katia, a Romani leader who brings John back into the fold. The dialogue doesn't have the mystique of 2 or 3, and one wonders about the absence of writers that contributed to 2 and 3. The fight scenes tend to be long and boring, with a horrid final fight scene involving endless stairs and samey opponents, that Wick ends up rolling down to to the bottom of, so he has to do it all over again against more faceless opponents. Briight spots in the action involve a fun \"Frogger\" style action scene in traffic around the Arc Du Triomphe in Paris, and an overhead view of John Wick setting opponents on fire with special incendiary rounds. The previous scene unfortunately re-uses the dance music from the Red Circle action sequence from the first film, so it seems they did not trust the audience to appreciate it without a musical callback to a better scene in a better movie. Speaking of music, the iconic Wick music is almost utterly absent other than the Red Circle Club music aforementioned, and there is no new music that is any way memorable.\n",

      "The cinematography is monochrome and depressing. It might as well be black and white for the color variation expressed.

      "As far as plot goes, if you were hanging on the edge of your seat wondering how Winston's betrayal of John in the last movie was going to resolve itself, well, they solve this issue by having a new baddie show up and shoot a fan favorite, Lance Reddick's Charon character, to make us forget Winston's betrayal, because now Wick can focus on killing the new Baddie instead of Winston. Also, if you were impressed by the mysterious Arab lord over the high table, to whom John sacrificed a finger in 3, John knocks him off easily within the first five minutes. Speaking of which, Donnie Yen's character is blind, and it's suggested he sacrificed his eyes the way John did his finger, but with none of the impact of seeing it happen on screen as it did with John in 3.\n",

I didn't discover it until 2019 before Chapter 3 and then I binged the previous movies before I saw that and instantly fell in love with it. On it's surface the premise of these movies could've easily turned out to be another generic action movie but what elevates these movies in my opinion is Chad Stahelski who with these movies has proved that he's one of the best action directors working in the business today. I'm definitely looking forward to whatever he does next as a director. The action here was phenomenal.\n",

That's why Wick was able to survive such ridiculous stuff in 3 and 4: he was a really high level vitality build.\n",

Without spoiling anything I will say that the end of this movie definitely surprised me as I didn't expect it to go where it did. After walking out I was conflicted on the ending but the more I thought about it the more It grew on me. I am intrigued to see where the franchise does go from here though. I assume Len Wiseman's Ballerina spin-off movie with Ana De Armas starring is next up and I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly excited to see that.\n",

I just watched the first 3 Wick movies before this one, and I'm glad I did. Because the quality between them is glaringly obvious. Any action flick like these you have to suspend your imagination, but between JW1 and JW4, well you might as well remove your brain before stepping in to the theater. I appreciated JW1 because he got hurt and you could see the suffering as the film went on. The shooting and fight scenes were tactical and tight and extremely well coordinated. JW2, little more suspension with the bullet proof suit, \"but it's gonna hurt\". And it did. He got hit by a couple cars, eh ok it's a movie. He got stitched up here and there, etc. But by the time we get to JW4, bullets are now bouncing off the bullet proof suit that everyone is wearing, not using cover and just covering their head with the coat, getting hit by cars at full speed over and over and over and then dropping from 2 stories, crushing the roof of a van and just chugging along. And John Wicks aim has gotten a lot worse. It's too bad. The series started to degrade just a bit with JW3 and this one just went full send.\n",

There is not even a single memorable action scene in the movie as all the scenes are something they have already used in the previous movies in the series.

It is entertaining, though. In this age of boring democratic and relatively peaceful life people are thirsty for violence, revenge and gore, so our natural and primitive animal instincts can get satisfied. This chapter is probably the weakest, by the way. It feels extremely repetitive. I had to rewatch the trailer to make sure I was not going to pay for the same movie I had already watched.

The fight is presented like a ballet, with smooth movements and highly skilled coordination. This film is absolutely spectacular, and I fell in love with every action that was put into it. The story is simple, but managed to captivate my attention, even though the Marquis character is a bit underdeveloped. But who can deny the greatness of Keanu Reeves as John Wick? She really is stunning! Even though the story is not very strong, the action shown still manages to make up for these weaknesses. However, I feel disappointed with some of the characters who are not so alive, especially vallian, but are still disguised again with the irony that John Wick has to pay for his actions.

This 4th installment was also a little hollywood pop or comic book for my taste, BUT, some of the action sequences were unique and fabulous: (1) the arc de triomphe sequence (street fighting in traffic), (2) the overhead no-cut sequence with the HE shotgun rounds, wow, (3) fighting a disguised Scott Adkins, very amusing if you know who he is, watch him in Avengement and the Debt Collector (1 and 2), those were great films, and (4) Donnie Yen sequences. The blind man capabilities were ridiculous of course, they should not have made him blind in the script, maybe half blind? The entire casting was great.

      "Review: If you're a fan of the franchise, you would definitely get satisfied by the whole movie and by its ending. Even for an unprofessional eye like mine the stunts look so well choreographed and the way they're shot is so perfectly executed that gives you the feeling you're almost there(that's why I recommend you to see it on IMAX, if you have the opportunity). On the other hand, because of the length of the movie you could get exhausted by all the fighting or at least l did. That also made me think - okay, Jon Wick is a really well trained killer, but where is the source of its stamina, because I'm not sure if even a professional athlete would be capable to keep up with all of these unstoppable running, wrestling and fighting(don't forget that an UFC fight is at most 25 minutes). Nevertheless, if you watched and most importantly - liked, the previous parts, you should definitely watch the final(for now) chapter.\n",

Without spoiling anything for those that havent seen it yet, it is an action movie masterpiece. From the opening parlay, to the crescendo. Even including what appeared to be a tongue in cheek commercial for a new Taran Tactical Innovations release lol. Skäarsgäard is stellar at drawing fan heat as the/one of the new bad guy(s). As a huge fan some of the directions of this film and its outcomes leave one to contemplate other entries ideas and/or spin-off opportunities with the loss of one of the best cast members. But, true fans of the Wick series should be more than pleased, I know I was. I was also greatly pleased at the near 3 hour run time, so I wasnt left wanting for material that would require nearly that time, shoved into the usual 90-120 min runtimes to appease to the TikTok generation. Thankfully this fleshed out well and completely. Enjoy folks!\n",

The plot is well known, and it is done better this time. This is not a movie, it is art. This movie will stand as the best movie as CR has played in. If you love 1-2-3, this give you the finesse and thrill, all the other movies combined. We sat struck in the theater. The filming is ground braking. The sound is taking you inside of JW world.

      "What it lacked in budget it made up for in style and love for the genre. Gone were the horrible shaky cam closeup fight scenes and fast cuts, that had plagued the genre for over a decade, gone were the cartoon physics from comic book movies. John Wick was gritty, realistic, but full of lore and world building and fun little quirks like the stylized subtitles.\n",

      "\n",
      "John Wick 4 is a symphony of violence. Every scene is impeccably lit, be it with moving lamps, fluorescent tubes, stage lights blasting through fog and waterfalls, window blinds casting long shadows and even incendiary bullets splashing the screen with light and color. This movie is beautiful to look at. Every frame looks like it could be a painting. The colors are rich and lively, unlike the ugly, dimly lit, grey muck like modern marvel movies. John Wick 4 is absolutely gorgeous.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the action choreography, aside from maybe Mad Max Fury Road or old Hong Kong cinema classics, nothing compares to this. This is on a different level. There's one often mentioned scene where the camera starts at eve level only to eventually give us a bird's eye view of John Wick taking out a bunch of goons with a combat shotgun loaded with incendiary rounds. There are mirrors in various locations, allowing us to view the action from multiple perspectives at the same time. It captures the heart pounding feel of a video game and becomes almost too much to keep track of. It's overwhelming, but in the best way possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of pounding, the soundtrack is mind blowing. The trademark techno / electro tracks by Le Castle Vania are back, and better than ever, but they are mixed with rock and industrial. There's a fun french rendition of \"Paint it Black\" as well. The finale then suddenly has western motifs taken straight from the great Ennio Morricone. None of it matches, but it doesnt matter. It's fun and feels great.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, by the time the finale rolls on, you feel as tired and exhausted as John Wick himself. Battered by hours of nonstop killing. The kill count is easily in the hundreds here, and this is one of the weaker points of the movie. At some point you become numb to the killing, and the bad guys rarely ever feel scary. They're too easy to kill. It would have been more efficient to have Wick followed by less, but more capable villains, and to have the movie be 40 minutes shorter. Did we really need two action scenes of him going up the same stairway to Sacre Coer? There are moments when the film grinds to a halt during the action scenes. Also, the entire opening act in Japan served little to no narrative purpose aside from setting up the villains. None of the Japanese characters show up in the story afterwards, and it feels more like setting up some kind of spinoff.\n",

You won't recognize him at first, but he plays his role with such glee and spark, overacting just enough and just at the right moments to stay memorable and lighten up an otherwise narratively unimportant scene. His German accent is perfect, almost realistic but with an extra bit of movie villain grit. So much fun. Someone please give this guy some real roles, he's too good to be wasting his talent on direct to streaming low budget junk.\n",

      "It should have made way more at the box office, but presumably the long runtime hurt it there. Now that it's out on streaming and physical media, that shouldnt discourage anyone from seeing it. If you haven't already, watch this movie. But watch it on the biggest screen you can.\n",

They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck.

If you liked the other movies you will enjoy this one. One different aspect to this movie is that there is no love interest,which i find quite refreshing as too many movie's old & new are spoilt by unnecessary love interest's that just go nowhere or twist the script into knots as they manipulate the story to somehow include the woman.

The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around.

      "\n",
      "The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole \"tracker\" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as \"loving husband\" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings.\n",

As others have said before, the plot is thin and in the background. The fights are front and center, are too long, and get tedious. I had to split the movie over two nights to make it through...and this comes from a guy who will watch Chapters 1 thru 3 every time they're on tv. This was a sad struggle to sit through. The stellar cast was wasted in this sequel. I see many complaints about dancers in the nightclubs or cars around the Arch de Triumph not noticing the kills around them. Since Ch 1, I've assumed this is an alternate reality (like a video game) where assassins run amok around the NPCs, and that is how it is supposed to appear in this version of NYC or this version of Paris. They are not the same versions of these cities if we were to travel there on vacation, so I can get past that. The script for this movie could not have been more than 5 pages of dialogue. Besides the repeat of \"I need guns. Lots of guns.\" and \"Yeah...\", there isn't much else. Winston gets off a one-liner now and then, but that's it.\n",

      "Review: Ecstatic. Esthetic. Artistic. Cathartic. Masterfully filmed, designed and visualized. Quite possible the most sensually intoxicating cinema experience I've had. A simplicity that feels almost poetic. In the midst of all the action, you suddenly question the meaning of life. Only to then again fall back into John Wic's gun-fu exstasy. Like clockwork. On and on. Keanu Reeves, who has maybe 2 pages of dialogue in the entire film series, manages to embody a character that is fascinating, questionable and yet understandable at the same time .\n",

      "Review: It's awesome to see how John Wick franchise has progressed, four movies in and it still has that same aesthetic, top to bottom, this film was just amazing. The editing was spot on, the scenery and focal shots are amazing, All of the actors were outstanding, the effects were some of the greatest I have ever seen, and the variety in the fight sequences was refreshing and new.\n",
      "\n",
      "The director and writer really nailed the action and entertainment in this movie. Honestly I was little worried that they couldn't keep up with the franchise going at such a high level, I'm glad it was not the case with this one.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review: This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see \"John Wick\" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The \"John Wick\" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no \"real world\" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the \"Gun-Fu\" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is \"the best action film of all time,\" maybe you should rent \"The Raid: Redemption\" or \"The Raid 2.\" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent \"Atomic Blonde.\" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to \"the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action.\" \"Atomic Blonde\" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+\n",

      "Review: I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).\n",

      "Review: John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotline Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.\n",
      "\n",
      "What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review: I'll have to admit that, having been a fan of the first two, I was a little disappointed with \"Parabellum\". I felt after a stellar start, it was a bit too long and some of the repetition in the fights was a bit wearing. It's interesting about the way movies work, that I too felt this was overlong, and repetitive, but it ends (rather than starts) with such a phenomenal series of action moments that I feel much better about it than I did the last one.\n",
      "\n",
      "With John Wick (Keanu Reeves) touring the world damaging the reputation of \"The Table\", they task The Marquis Vincent De Gramont (Bill Skarsgard) with finally bringing him to heel. Having extracted a terrible revenge on The New York Continental, Gramont blackmails blind assassin, and former friend of Wick, Caine (Donnie Yen) to hunt him down. Now a serious liability to his friends, Winston (Ian McShane) comes forward with a plan to free Wick from his debts once and for all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'd actually go as far as to describe the first two thirds of the movie as being lacklustre. It's only really Donnie Yen's reluctant killer that offers anything that we haven't seen before. Much of those earlier scenes seen Wick killing hordes of heavily shielded enemies, so again, as with the third one, the bullets are more to stun people rather than kill them outright. The Marquis sees Skarsgard, play aristocratic villain, which again the series has done before, though not perhaps with someone struggling as much with the accent as he is.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some raw moments with Lance Reddick in these early scenes too, who, as ever, was great.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last third though, from the moment he steps out of the subway into Paris and battles across the city is phenomenal. It's a breathless action scene that lasts around 45 minutes, barely pausing for a moments respite. It seems him use cars, motorbikes, and all sorts of the weaponry to fend off assassins sent to stop him reaching a certain destination and it really makes great use of Paris as a character in the action. I must say, the scenes when he uses \"Dragons Fire\" bullets is perhaps the most video game thing I've seen a movie do. All the earlier inertia is blown away by perhaps the best sequence the series has ever done, and I do think that I probably feel warmer about the film because it ends with it's best sequence, whereas Parabellum opened with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I'm happy for the story of John himself to end here. We've got a couple of spin offs that are in development that can keep the world going, but I'd really struggle to think what more they could do.\n",

      "It's non-stop shooting and fighting. So much so that I found myself fast forwarding through much of it as the movie dragged on. Have to admire the toughness of the '71 Barracuda that Wick commandeers though. Despite being rammed head-on into a handful of stationary objects, and smacked in the rear quarter, it comes out without a scratch, other than losing both doors, hinges and all. They even ripped off the plot (or as the director likely would claim, \"Paid homage to\") the 1979 movie \"The Warriors\" for that sequence.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review: From the dog to an action epic that, with absolute certainty, changed the face of the genre in cinema. There are 170 minutes of little talking and a lot of beatings, shooting, lunging, more shooting, cars, motorcycles, dogs and anything else that could become a weapon in the hands of John Wick (Keanu Reeves), his allies and enemies. Here, the script by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch is inspiringly economical. Wick decides that he will take revenge on everyone, he discovers that a new representative of the Summit, the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgard), has a plan to kill him, which makes the protagonist look for new (old) allies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even for one of the longest chapters in the saga, it's how Stahelski presents the few moments of pause before the unbridled, pulse-pounding action. The section in which the film prepares the action sequences and signals this with a play of lights in the photography orchestrated by Dan Laustsen, is accurate in determining \"the return to the game\", and how there is a path of pure chaotic beauty that makes up the different scenarios and that this is far from becoming tiring; it is an escape into violent, visually attractive and now less sumptuous entertainment, but which continues to rely on aesthetics as the principle of reality with increasingly absurd figures. Therefore, the script written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch doesn't make an effort to deepen the plot, it just knows how to organize the necessary elements to drive the action.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for the same reason, this is how the insertion of new characters always works, since they are pieces based on the mythological Baba Yaga, but who manage to play satisfactory roles within the action time without overshadowing the mysticism with which John Wick moves with little words, but packaged in the characteristic black suit and fighting techniques. With great simplicity, the script does the task of expanding the endless figures that make up the High Table in this long dance number that extends between characters, settings and choreography. It's as if it were a game governed by its own rules, which are still little known, but which serve the spectacle of a masterpiece action film that is proposed. The dynamics of scenarios jump from New York, Japan, then Germany to Paris without losing sight of long, fascinating shots of increasingly challenging action.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no intention on the part of the directors to sign the film with anything that is not available for the action scenes and plot threads. The transition of environment within the scenes is always masterful and never leaves the viewer lost. Something tremendously important in a film where its action scenes last dozens of minutes and cover huge areas while John Wick is beaten and beaten to an amusingly frightening extent. Wick faces cars on the streets of Paris, then a crowd of villains in an abandoned house, but Stahelski and Lausten's camera makes a point of flying above the action in a plongee (camera from above) that cuts across the environment as dozens of people appear from four corners to kill Wick. And all of this culminates in the climb up an almost mythological staircase, just like that, without breathing or letting anyone in the cinema come up for air. Added to this is stunt work and choreography that transforms the film into an incredible ballet of violence. The timing of everything in the scene is wonderfully well thought out and executed, all in exciting harmony with the stylish sets and production design work that makes everything seem made for each other. The big nightclub in Russia brings together a huge crowd, but nothing ever seems out of control or without function.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Continental hotel in Osaka is beautiful, as well as the sequence there demonstrates the enormous effort to show even more deeply the mythology of this world of assassins and the differences and personality of each place where this entire assassination organization still roams unseen by the eyes. Of the world. What's not lacking in \"John Wick 4\" is personality, each sequence, character and plot decision goes through this desire to be unique. And seeing something new in cinema in a genre is wonderful for fans who are so orphaned by this type of surprise, which also ends up being one of the best things you can find when you decide to dive into the dark of an action film. The traditional world of John Wick is new and completely fun. While the first John Wick was never about the dog, this fourth film is still about this man who can't find peace. Just that. To achieve this, it needs to become one of the most anticipated films of the year and a franchise that made the genre rethink its intentions. And whenever this happens, the spectator wins.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sequence - set to an atmospheric soundtrack by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard - of a chase and fight in the middle of an underground club in Germany, complete with an exquisite game of lighting and slow motion, is just one of the insane examples of the stylish and Stahelski's creativity, always seeking to renew movements and plans to new levels. In this sense, this is where Stahelski's directing control is concentrated, which makes John Wick an outlier among titles in the genre in composing an epic film full of climaxes. The scene that unfolds at the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris, is another example of the metrically calculated way in which the action takes place in the franchise, where extras are not just extras, but fundamental pieces for the visual spectacle of destruction, violence, physical clashes, of the opponents who appear in vain to take down Baba Yaga in exchange for a reward, and also, it is an example of how Stahelski references the genre - with direct nods to western films - while exploring his own style in language and mythology.\n",
      "\n",
      "If we accept the cheating and absurdity with a smile on our faces, it's because we already know in advance that bending the rules is essentially the only rule that matters in the \"John Wick\" universe. This is the agreement that films have made and renewed with their audiences, and the best features - the second chapter and now this \"John Wick 4\" - are those that most openly disdain the expected rules of the realistic urban chase film. In the 2014 film, everything was still being worked out; In the third, the concern with exposing and extending the mythology seemed above all a distraction. It's almost ironic that, with its nearly three-hour running time, \"John Wick 4\" is being received in the media as a spectacle of exaggeration, because all the choices the film makes, based on the rules it breaks and recreates for its convenience, are guided by the essential. There is no narrative fat left, no distractions; Characters have their profiles assigned according to the action opportunities they can offer, and everything boils down to getting from point A to point B without much dialogue, without much explanation, and in the most impactful way possible. The slow and affected monologues serve as a narrative breather and also to create expectations, in the Sergio Leone fashion: each dramatic pause in Keanu's speech will be compensated later with the accelerated and explosive action that we already crave.\n",
      "\n",
      "When \"John Wick 4\" places an entire telephone exchange for the assassins' syndicate at the top of the Eiffel Tower, we accept this information as a fact of the real world without the need for further explanation because we know that this Paris is part of a simulated reality built on top of lots and lots of broken rules. To get as close as possible to the dynamics of action games (where we accept without question that reality is bending to fantasy and new laws of physics), John Wick has increasingly abolished everything expected from a \"realistic\" narrative\", starting with the very need for expository dialogues. Keanu Reeves has never said so little and has never been so physically demanding as in this fourth film. The only realistic thing that needs to be established in the film - and without which none of this would be justified - is the physicality of the fights. The impact needs to be felt as something real. \"John Wick 4\" benefits greatly from its martial arts-trained cast (Donnie Yen needs no comment), and the work of the stunt doubles on set is successfully mixed with CGI to create action scenes that appear to have real impact according to our laws of physical. Well, the only serious problem with this fourth chapter is that, with this length, it can't help but be an indulgent film. One gets the feeling, especially at the beginning, that some scenes could be shorter and could be better linked to the whole. About 20 or 30 minutes less and the result would perhaps be even better.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this does not compromise the experience, which relies on the fact that the viewer considers the sight of a well-dressed Keanu Reeves killing people as one of the genuine pleasures of modern cinema. If you don't think so or if the previous ones didn't do anything for you, it won't be this fourth \"John Wick\" that will change your opinion. However, it is the spirit of celebration, of spectacle, that remains: a saga that began unpretentious with an actor whose career was stagnant became, on its own merits, something made to be enjoyed on the big screen and capable of bringing great satisfaction to fans of genre cinema. After all, it's not always the case, but sometimes, blockbuster cinema really manages to give the viewer a gift. Achieving a refreshing level of creativity in his direction, Stahelski positions \"John Wick\" as one of the most innovative franchises of the genre, making this chapter 4 an action epic that reaches its peak by embracing the most insane possibilities for the sake of entertainment. And judging by the box office success of this fourth chapter and even though our protagonist has theoretically ended his arc, it's not at all difficult to predict new sequels on the way.\n",

      "Review: When you start watching a John Wick movie, you expect it to be a non stop action ride. Thats true for this 4th chapter in the most John Wick way possible and we wouldn't have it any other way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keanu Reeves' silent assassin John Wick is always a treat to watch. People do complain about his lack of dialogue but in this setting it works to his advantage as the action tells most of the story. John Wick is a force of nature, something everybody fears to be the other side of his gun. And in this movie, its maximum carnage from him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't believe that 4 movies in and the director Chad Stahelski and his stunt choreography team haven't let us get bored of the action yet. Its surprisingly refreshing in every movie and each builds on top of the previous one, raising the bar higher. The story's tightly knit too, so you feel like the fight scenes organically come out of it and never feel forced.\n",

      "Review: By the time Chapter 4 came out, I'd come to the realization that I have no memory of what happened in the last three movies plot-wise, aside from the ending of Parabellum. I don't consider myself feather-brained, so it must be the absolute emptiness that was in those stories that wiped everything out. After watching Chapter 4, I reckon I will forget it just the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story is the same grandiose, mythical assassin society jenga that seemingly exists in a realm of its own, away from civilization. There is no tangible reaction from the rest of the world to anything that happens during their disputes. Every single move or action simply adheres to the rule of cool. Visually, the movie is indeed very cool, with vigorous music, great pacing in the fights, and a towering number of killers. This time, (I theorize, maybe the other movies did this already) it goes for a The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly motion of introducing three opposing players, Wick, Caine, and the Tracker. The goals of the last two and their actions rarely match, but what does it matter? The rule of cool is in action. Under this rule, flashbangs do not make you deaf and disoriented just because you are unable to see to begin with. This is videogame logic. Cool one-liner, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fights are immensely ferocious, even if, in some cases, the obsession with long takes makes the fodder goons act silly as they farcically delay getting up just to match their queue for when Keanu turns around. Not that I'm advocating for some Bourne hogwash again, with a shaky camera and cuts extravaganza. God knows we had a fill of those, but those techniques did exist exactly to thwart that kind of awkwardness.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other ultimately frustrating thing are Kevlar suits, which I had grown to despise by the end of the movie. If the problem of goons not hitting your lead guy is solved by making them hit him but ordaining it to mean nothing, then you should probably reconsider how you approach the action scenes with a high number of guns all together. Not that the movie goes overboard with Kevlar deflection. There are many scenes of gun porn where it is irrelevant, but the fact remains that trying to mix realistic reloading with this kind of foolery does not work.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know what happened behind the scenes for them to decide the seldom amount of spoken dialogue by Keanu to be delivered with all the implications of him having brain damage as he inadvertently makes awkward pauses between every word. It is an unintentional comedy regardless. Keanu's sole acting in these movies is his physical body language during the fights, as far as I'm concerned anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is enjoyable, mindless, stunt-heavy lunacy, as it was intended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hopefully, they will let him lay down and pursue new projects themselves, preferably with any kind of script that isn't just an assortment of locations to fight in.\n",

      "Review: This thing is a powerhouse in the action genre. Directed by Chad Stahelski and starring the one-face-to-rull-them-all Keanu Reeves, the film delivers an electrifying experience from the very first shot. One of the film's most impressive aspects is its action sequences, this thing DOESN'T HOLD BACK, the fight choreography is a work of art, expertly crafted and executed with precision,handcrafted by a stuntman himself, and that just about shows up every time there's punches in the frame, showcasing a keen eye for detail.\n",

The movie is very easy to predict, have nothing to make you think about. It started fine, but then it went on continuous cycle that spin over and over again for more then 1.5 hours.

      "Review: Now this is an whole lot better than \"John Wick - Paracetamol\" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor \"James Bond\" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz\" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting \"thwack\" and \"pow\" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same.\n",

      "Review: John Wick Chapter 4, directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves as the main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10.\n",

Went out of the theater twice during the movie to get some popcorn and a go to the toilet. Did it deliberatley during the fight scenes. Didnt feel like I missed anything. Wick rolling down the stairs reminded me of Neymar. How dumb and boring was that. Before that, he fell from a 5th floor to the street and got up without problem. Even my son found that to be too much. The New York Russians appear to be in a Catholic church. Baba Jaga they keep refering to is not the bogeyman. Its an old woman, thats what baba means. Something like a witch. But whatever. The good thing in the movie are some colorful protagonists. I cannot but think these people giving 10 stars have a vested interest to do so.\n",

      "Review: John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own.

But walks away from getting hit by so many cars I lost count, literally falling out of buildings... But then dies from a mere stomach wound.......

The director's love for neon colours is clearly seen in the movie and the all the mythology about the high table, continentals about different hotels throughout the world the leaders who control it the rules on which this big assassin world works which the high table even cannot defy.

      "Review: \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is a film that offers what its trailer promises: action and more action, achieving a product whose production is outstanding, colorful cinematography and risky camera movements, as well as outstanding editing work and a soundtrack well done. Its big problem, the negative point, is the most important part: the script, which is repetitive, tired and unimaginative, exploiting the action theme without really having a coherent story. Everything ends up being absurd only with a good job in the fight choreography. An overrated film, practically bad and with an excessive duration for the null story it tells.\n",

      "Review: JW4 has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike but that's a mystery to me. JW1 introduced us to the world of the Continental, JW himself was tough but vulnerable and funny and the fight scenes were like nothing we'd seen before. It still had one foot in reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "But from JW2 onwards Mr Wick has become indestructible, an unkillable superhero with magical powers. Sure there were some good moments in 2 and 3 and some wonderful choreography but for me, everything that made the first instalment so amazing is missing from JW4. The humour has gone and many of the set piece fights look like they were shot during rehearsals when they were being practiced at half speed. You can see the stunt men waiting for their cue to attack. Worst of all though, it's boring. I had to turn it off and go back to it the next day. The bullet proof suits are ridiculous and reminded me of the missteps of the Bond franchise before the Craig reboot - (invisible car?) Keananunu is obviously older now and can't throw himself around like he could back in the day and maybe this is one of the problems. The biggest though is that when the protagonist is indestructible there is no jeopardy so therefore no interest.\n",

S if I give 4 a 6. In John Wick 4 it is more in the open and it just doesn't feel the same. The fight scenes are just not as good as in the other movies. It's a decent film, especially the scene with Scott Adkins is good (he steels the show, give this man a spinoff or his own movie), and the scene with the shot from above is awesome. The cinematography is great, but it just doesn't give me the vibe that the other movies had.\n",

      "Review: It's just simply not the sequel to fulfil everyone's wishes, but after two fairly dull instalments following the original revenge action-thriller model, the fourth chapter in the John Wick series is violent, slick and shocking. However, that's not to say that this movie comes without its flaws. Because even with its overlong runtime weakening the actual product, there's still some other issues that block it from ranking higher than the first film.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you've paid the entry fee with a craving mainly for kick-ass action with Keanu Reeves at the centre, visually striking direction and with a lack of care for sensical plot, you're in luck. Although each are usually several minutes too long, this film is loaded with the most distinctive and hooking combat fight scenes located throughout the entire franchise. For many, watching John Wick brutally shoot up a bunch of bad guys in a very stylistic fashion is entertaining, but the amount of damage taken by the characters is also where one of the film's most distracting plot holes roots between.\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason a lot of the action scenes are all-fun-with-no-suspense-or-excitement is because it seems that damage and brutality doesn't really apply to John Wick, where everyone else he fights typically dies at the instant. He can go tumbling down a humorously long staircase and get shot or stabbed, but he can always get back up with seemingly no impact from the injuries. The motives presented by the characters is also a sizeable issue, giving the movie what feels like so many convoluted purposes to the point where the whole project could've just been thrown away and forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some will agree that within the context of a film review, the critic needs to get the positives in first and finish with the flaws. This review doesn't follow that order because John Wick: Chapter 4 is still a decent action-thriller you'd want to leave off on a good note from. Anyway, this film is definitely the best of the sequels due to the fact that's it's entertaining, more distinctive, the writing is much better and there's surprises along the way to await for. It may have a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it always feels like the plot is always moving forward, even if it gets a bit ridiculous at times. Performances by Keanu Reeves, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen also deliver some of the effect. If this is the finale to the overrun franchise, this is a solid way to come to an end.\n",

      "Review: I haven't read all the reviews, so pardon my ignorance if my comment is repetitive. I was highly amused by the director's \"borrowing\" of scenes from the movie \"The Warriors\" during John Wick's travails during his journey to reach the site of the final duel. Especially obvious were the scenes where lady radio announcer provided the play-by-play location of John while exhorting the mob chasing him to pick up the pace. It was such a flashback for me that I thought for a moment that it was the same announcer from \"The Warriors\", except she would be much older now. Maybe this and the whole final chase sequence were easter eggs provided by the director and producers as a nod to the original action-packed sequence leading to the ultimate conclusion. Then again maybe \"The Warriors\" borrowed it to pay homage to an earlier movie.\n",

But a blind assassin in an old fashioned, 'pistols at dawn' duel? BLIND??? TOTALLY silly. Characters like the Japanese daughter which went nowhere. Random black guy with dog? The same stuntmen killed again and again ( even in the same clothes). Great flame thrower, bird's eye, computer game action scene. But being run over 20 times and the longest ever ascent of the Sacre Coeur steps. Eugh. Way too long and silly. Bring back Keanu and a clear plot development. This was a disappointment.\n",

Don't get me wrong - acting is sufficient, production fine, and there is a lot of action, but the story, well, all that blabla about the High Table and so on, is just redundant noise to set up the stage for different and exotic settings for more bumbum. I really think they should have left the first movie alone. That one is still cool and hot but like the Taken (Liam Neeson) movies with every added \"chapter\" the idea and quality of the story and character thins out.

Some the set pieces used in the film were visually stunning and the fight choreography was terrific. I won't spoil anything although the third act was the best part of the film in terms of action and suspense. I personally think this is the best action franchise since the Jason Bourne films.

There was a lot of pressure on the 4th installment of the John Wick movie series, seeing as director Chad Stahelski has publicly stated that this will be the last installment of the John Wick franchise. Well it's safe to say that it has lived up to expectations magnificently. The action was nothing less than what we have come to expect from the franchise. The fight scenes are a thrilling, captivating, works of art that should be eligible for an Oscar on their own thanks to the jaw-dropping cinematography and direction. The characters and their overall storylines were clearly better than those of John Wick 3, but I have to admit I might be a bit biased as a result of some wonderful performances from Ian McShane, Donnie Yen, and Hiroyuki Sanada. Unlike Halle Berry's character in the last movie, these 3 characters that I just mentioned felt more alive to me. They felt real, each one unique in it's own way and style. And that makes me appreciate the writing of this movie so much more. The story, which truthfully felt a bit slow at times, was captivating enough to keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. However, I have to say that the plot is in no way perfect. The movie has it's cons obviously, like some of the average dialogue and cringey one-liners. But trust me, that didn't stop me from having an enjoyable and emotional watch. It was an extraordinarily good series which got the end it deserved. I was crying my heart out by the end to say the least. A must watch for all movie kinds of movie lovers.\n",

I would have given this a 10/10 but it is a bit slow in parts and very long. I understand they need to take the time to build up and down and they want to make it epic, but I personally think they probably could have shaved at least 20 minutes or even 40 and had it just over 2 hours instead of just under 3 hours. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing and I think 3 hours is long for any movie, even LOTR is a bit draining in parts and those movies are masterpieces. The action sequences are incredible. I love the way they combine martial arts, blades, and guns together in such a cool way. He even uses nunchucks and makes it cool. The locations are beautiful lots of night stuff with bright neon lights in Japan and Europe with classical music and fine works of art. This really is an action movie for the thinking man, unlike that Marvel trash the commoners watch. I keep thinking with every John Wick sequel I hope this isn't the one that finally jumps the shark and ruins the franchise but they have managed to deliver every time. I just hope they don't make the mistake of focusing too much on character and story. In every other movie that would be a good thing but John Wick actually hit on a fundamental truth that in action movies that stuff really doesn't matter, I just want to see lots of cool stunts and fight sequences with the bare minimum of story to hold it all together. Great movie. If they can get away with it and maintain quality I'd love to see them get all the way to John Wick 7.\n",

Not sure why but like other good action films to give it a pass on so many of the glaring weakness or far fetched things in the movie. But that is why they can be fun. Wick is basically a super hero without the fancy suits , well I guess one fancy suit, or magical abilities. I wonder what the official count is for the hit rate for bullets flying at him. I think is must be like a 0.1% hit rate. Maybe this is a prequel to star wars and all of the gunmen grow up to be storm troopers. Not to mention how many cars hit him. One weakness was the villain, most villains don't subcontract their work as much as he did but what do I know, maybe they do. All in all not a bad watch.\n",

Donnie Yen plays a blind martial arts expert, a role he knows all too well since he played an identical character in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And that really sets up the debate around whether plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, or just a dumb, lazy rip off. There are references aplenty from the sci-fi/kung fu genres, including some of Keanu's own efforts. He knows kung fu-and shows us. It's kung fu'd up the wazoo. I imagine the director, a stunt man himself, simply Scotch taped together one fight scene after the next. FOR THREE HOURS! Three writers are credited with crafting 380 words of dialogue for Mr. Reeves. Okay, I read that Stahelski and Reeves stripped out roughly half the dialogue written for his character in the initial script. Accordingly, I would have stripped the writers of their entire salary. The first instalment featuring this legendary hit-man was just that, a smash hit. However, much like the Matrix sequels John Wick: Chapter 4 just gets on my wick.\n",

      "Review: They need to end it here . This was a dismal attempt at whatever they were trying to do. The dark scenes where they hide john Wicks face so the stuntman can do the heavy lifting. Pooy shot and poorly written. John Wick needs to be no more. I am glad we only paid six bucks to rent this. And at that amount , I feel like I got robbed . The entire sequence of tnos movie makes zero sense. Keneau I am sure is embarrassed by this fourth chapter of what was a great series . It is getting to be like the Friday the 13th series. This is seriously one bad movie. The writers and director let us down terribly. Save your money.\n",

      "Review: So i watched the movie in IMAX. The beginning blew me away already, punch after punch my head felt like it wanted to explode in the first minute of the film, whole Theater vibrated and set the mood for the rest of the movie. The action and fight scenes are incredible. My jaw dropped almost every five minutes into the action, creative teamwork and deaths. Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me. Incredible locations and mood switches, intense moments combined with the IMAX system was just so dope. Of course there were some unrealistic moments where a normal human would have been dead already, but it is a movie, so they got to keep Mr. Wick alive somehow.\n",

      "Review: One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John.\n",

      "\n",
      "I enjoyed the fight choregraphy and I really appreciate them bringing in Donnie Yen, but I find that , when compared to the first John Wick for example, Keanu's acting seem to be much more cringe in this one. His lines are painfully forced monosyllabic and/or one sentence answers that seem to be almost FORCED coming out of his mouth, and seriously compare his dialogue with the first movie and you'll see it's night and day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also find that the movie has become a bit too bloated, with unnecessary fights being put in, with many of those fight scenes not necessarily involving John Wick himself, and a lot of plot inconsistencies are just swept under the rug (why was the Elder replaced? Why was he so easily reach and assassinated this time around? How have we never heard of the Marquis until now? What happened to the Adjudicator?).\n",
      "\n",
      "The film is simultaneously too long but still inadequately explains the hanging plot lines while continuing to add new lore randomly out of nowhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The action sequences are still amazing, but now it seems a bit...tired, I may be wrong here but I found the action in the previous movies to be much more satisfying and punchier. In the end, I find that it didn't live up to its hype as \"the greatest John Wick movie ever\".\n",

As the saga continued we get a Fast & Furious problem where it just doesn't make any sense story wise or action wise.\n",

So many places to get highlighted. And for god sake John Wick is frkin immortal. Enemy keep missing shots after shots. And there is Donnue Yen. One of my favorite actor. The battle music is very great. And mostly I like the part when the camera rotates like a FPS Tournament. They give you some rotating sort of effect and a top camera view. Totally like FPS tourney'and yes John Wick still love dogs. Best 2023 movie so far. But sadly it showed that Wick is dead.

      "Review: 💯100% MAJOR Spoilers Ahead: I had to buy this movie on Amazon Prime because the tickets were sold out, but I did get to see it on a huge 8K projector, which basically felt like a theater, so I had to watch it again. Anyway, if you're confused with my score, here's where I stand in each category: Story - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Pacing - 10/10 Visuals - 10/10 Score - 10/10 Resonate - 10/10 Entertainment or Emotion - 30/30 (This could obviously change in the future.)

      "\n",
      "Obviously, I think every single category is stellar. From a story perspective, it's very heartfelt and has some lessons in life. Obviously John is trying to get revenge over the high table, but John and other characters in the movie start to question where this path of revenge will take him. His death was done beautifully and got me emotional. Everyone in this movie was shockingly good. Literally, every performance, Donnie Yen stole the show, Ian McShane was incredible, Bill Skarsgard was fantastic and was very threatening, Shamier Anderson was also incredible in this movie. But obviously, Keanu Reeve's gave a stellar performance in this movie. Every scene is choreographed beautifully. Every action scene is even more memorable then the last, and each one is better than incredible. When you get to the final few action scenes, there are some of the greatest of all time. The pacing is fantastic, each act is distinct and different, and none of these scenes feel repetitive. I seriously don't get that complaint. The visuals are the best they have ever been in this franchise, and the visuals for the first one are incredibly underrated. The final battle between Caine and Wick have some of the best visuals I've ever seen. When John is dying in the sunrise, I was and am speechless.\n",

      "HOW ARE MOVIES THIS GOOD??? The score is as always incredible. I listen to the score for all of these movies all the time. It's one of those scores that just reminds you of how good the movie was. This movie stuck with me for the entire week when I first watched it, and now that I've rewatched it, I can't get it out of my head. It's that good. I've thought about this for a long time, but now I think I'm confident: This movie has the most entertaining action sequences of all time. Literally, I wasn't bored for a SINGLE SECOND! A SEEECCONND!!! I know that term get's thrown around a lot, but here, it's actually true. Literally, from the opening sequence, I was HOOKED. He's practicing his punches, and every punch, and every gunshot echoed across the room, and it provided for the best theater experience I've ever had. There were so many scenes in this movie where I got out of my seat, and wen't NUTS! There is also so much emotion in this movie, especially when you get to the end, my jaw was on the floor, but here, I actually mean it, there were so many scenes where I actually got teary eyed.\n",

      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Review: As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!\n",
      "\n",
      "My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going \"Yeah...\" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.\n",

With all the current junk in cinemas and online streaming, I am glad we still manage to get quality movies because that is what audiences want.\n",

It starts with John Wick punching a wooden board, with one punch making a loud impact that shook and vibrated the whole room, all thanks to the IMAX speakers. Then we are re-introduced to the Bowery King, played by Laurence Fishburne, who delivers a monologue, with Fishburne's delivery making it sound Shakespearean. Wick continues to punch the board with each bang creating a build-up. They even did a match cut from Lawrence of Arabia, capturing the smooth scene transition.\n",

      "Keanu Reeves, what can I say about this man; Keanu is also 60 years old but shows no sign of it in terms of his physicality. On the surface, Mr. Wick is a cold assassin who will pile bodies on top of bodies just to escape the hitman world. However, despite playing someone famous and feared, Reeves has the saddest eyes that make him feel vulnerable. He elevates the character so much that if any other actor played John Wick, it would have been generic and dull.\n",

In this movie, he is used effectively and gets to shine.\n",

      "Rina Sawayama was a fantastic addition to the series, where she had some wicked action scenes in the first act. I am interested in seeing more of her character, hopefully. Hiroyuki Sanada, a familiar face you may have seen in other action movies, was great in the scenes he had. He is an actor and martial artist that I feel does not get enough credit that he deserves.

Most of the time, it becomes an unimaginative and safe choice to shoehorn actors into a \"bubble\", because it worked out so well before, but here, the film did a great job of making you hate this guy, and with a good reason to. He's a rotten fruit of a person dressed in fancy and slick clothing to parade around his importance. At the start, it is clear he is not messing around or someone you should mess with.\n",
      "\n",

One set piece involved John Wick making his way up 220 stairs of the Sacré Coeur in Paris while facing off enemies, which was a sight to behold that my jaw was wide up during one part. It was funny and spectacular in execution. Or how about the Berlin club fight scene that was hypnotising and wonderful.\n",

He does bleed, and I learned in Predator (1987) that if it bleeds, it can die. Personally, Mr. Wick chooses not to die, not yet. The movie makes him out to be a legend, a myth, someone impossible to kill in the eyes of other assassins. It could have been a Fast & Furious scenario where things get too stupid with every character being death-proof. On the other hand, what surprised me about this movie is how it leans onto the idea of mortality, hanging onto what is left of his life and wondering how long this can keep going; despite all the pain and tiredness that life throws at you. Your lead character, quite literally, has had enough.\n",

      "Review: Sure. A lot of action. But it really was quite...dumb. Sooooo much close range shooting and every one misses except the \"good guys\"? C'mon. The acting was fair. Just the same John Wick as in every other John Wick movie. At this point, the movie has an 8.2 rating. I don't see it. This is Marvel superhero stuff. Hit by cars, shot, falling out of buildings and still...walking. Sorry, but a lot of action is great. But a lot of unrealistic, unbelievable action is for fantasies. It is as if all they wanted to do was pack in a bunch of Kill Bill killing times ten and call it an action movie. Long on blood, short on, well, everything else.\n",

The villain is stereotypically rich, arrogant but handsome who doesn't get a chance to show his fighting skills. His chapter ends with a single bullet. John's body is made up of high grade titanium alloy.

      "Review: John Wick: Chapter 4, where do I even begin? This action-packed extravaganza certainly knows how to deliver stunning fight scenes and keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a worthy addition to the franchise, but like any good action flick, it's not without its quirks.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, let's talk about the positives. The stunts and choreography in this film are nothing short of mind-blowing. Donnie Yen's performance as Caine is nothing less than unbelievable. He fights like a blind man, and yet every move is executed flawlessly. And of course, Keanu Reeves is the embodiment of John Wick himself. It's hard to imagine anyone else in this role. Well, except for the few instances where his enemies conveniently wait their turn to attack him. I guess they must have gotten lost in the mesmerizing and brutal choreography.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of which, the action in this film is lightning-fast. It's a shame that so many people choose to watch computer-generated \"superheroes\" when they can witness the raw and thrilling fights between Reeves and Yen. I mean, who needs Ant-Man when you have John Wick? The sheer speed and intensity of the action are something that words can't truly capture-you just have to experience it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto the not-so-great aspects. Clocking in at nearly three hours, the film does feel a bit bloated at times. Some scenes drag on unnecessarily, and there are a few confusing plot points that could have used more development. Plus, let's not forget the reliance on fan service and callbacks to previous films. While it's great for die-hard fans, it might leave newcomers scratching their heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these flaws, John Wick: Chapter 4 still manages to deliver an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. The world-building continues to expand, and we're introduced to intriguing new characters like Marquis and Shimazu. Don't get me wrong, Keanu Reeves is still an unstoppable force, even if he's starting to take his John Wick role to hilariously stoic heights. And let's not forget Lance Reddick's unforgettable portrayal of Charon, the courteous concierge we all grew to love. His presence will be sorely missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, if you're a fan of jaw-dropping action sequences, John Wick: Chapter 4 won't disappoint. It's a satisfying conclusion-well, maybe-to one of the best action franchises out there. The breathtaking visuals, captivating fight choreography, and expanding universe make for an entertaining experience. Whether this is truly the end or just the beginning of more John Wick adventures, I can't deny the sheer joy I felt watching this film. And hey, if they ever make a John Wick video game, sign me up for some top-down shooter action.\n",

All of the original characters have a satisfactory conclusion to their character arcs and even newer characters make you instantly make you wish for a standalone movie to know more about their own story. I feel for all the people waiting for a slow moment in the movie so that they can go to the toilet because those scenes are basically non-existent. The scene elevating this movie from a 9 to 10 for me personally is in Paris when everything suddenly transitions into a top-down view (reminiscent of games like hotline miami). The scene then transitions back into the normal third person view and back again into the top-down perspective. All of this looking like a seamless one-shot. Sure, there were some noticeable green-screen shots towards the end but that didn't make the action shots before any less cool.\n",

      "Review: This action movie is great, it's a way greater than all the previous plotless Wick's movies, it surely stands alone in the series. But, there is one huge BUT, there is a black spot in the middle of each frame, a black hole which intensely sucks and this hole is the John Wick and the hundred years old hairy wooden hippy playing John Wick - poor Mr. Reeves. Everything is totally WEAK about this character from his name to the person playing it. Firstly, Baba (Yaga) in Russian is a degrading word for \"woman\" equivalent to the words like wench, slut, broad, dame or hag if the woman is old and vicious which is the case of our Johny what makes him in plain English \"Hag Yaga\" - how stupid is that? Baba Yaga is a vicious old witch hag from Russian kids' folklore stories. It doesn't sound cool in relation to a coldblooded killerman, it sounds like Bubba Gump shrimp. It would be much coole to call him Kashchey the Deathless which is Voldemort/Sauron character from Russian folklore. And what is a Belorussian gypsy I'd like to ask the creators of this movie? There is no Romas or Gypsies in Belorussia only Hag Yaga - Lukashenko! Gypsies live in Moldova, West Ukraine, Romania, Hungary. The authors clearly don't know and don't care a damn what they are making the movie about! Ok, we can leave that alone. The worst part about this film isn't etymology anyway, but is that I laughed at every Mr. Weak's fight scene as bad as if I was watching Mr. Bean, and, believe me, that's not a good sign for an action packed dramatic serious shoot-em-up Kill-Bill movie. For the part of Wick with the same success they could have cast Adrian Brody straight from Polanski's Pianist. Old, stooping, bow-legged, hippy-looking, bearded and hairy Keanu Reeves is the worst cast an action film has ever known in the history of the world cinema! He should have played parts of scientists and musicians not roles of Steven Seagal. Every fight scene with Weak John looks crying-out fake. He doesn't mean it, he doesn't mean a single blow, he doesn't even try - he is OLD, he can't do martial arts and acrobatics and it's a torture to watch him trying. He doesn't produce an impression of lethal killer, he produces impression of a laughing stock, of a scarecrow on a stick. When I think how much time it is going to take the characters of Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Arny, Stallone, Jet Li, Jacky Chan or Black Mamba from Kill Bill to annihilate John to nanoparticles, my answer is from one to five seconds. You know how long would last a fight scene between Great John Weak and cleric John Preston from Equilibrium (2002)? - about one sec - and there would be three Johns Wicks. Even Charles' Angeles would beat all the dust out of poor Johny in ten seconds. The only main character from old action movies whom Weak John would confront without being killed instantly is John McLane. It would take about five minutes of some heavy fighting and a lucky chance for McLane to finish off the Weak one. All in all Keanu Reeves completely lacks what it takes to produce on screen the effect of a deadly threat, he only makes one laugh and pity him. It is clearly visible that when he throws some big bloke, it's not he who do the action, it's the stuntmen who jumps and sends himself flying, Keanu Reeves has little strength only to move his own hands and carcass through the air. Keira Knightley was wielding nunchucks better in Domino than this poor old superhero. And as an actor - he is not an actor, he is a log trying to look serious and menacing. In spite of all this said it's still a surprisingly good action movie from the old times mostly due to the good job of the rest of the crew.\n",

The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always, phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences.

Shot at, beat, kicked, thrown, run over by cars, trucks, and fat Russians. By the end the guy is basically beat to death. Is this the story of a warrior or is it some kind of metaphorical journey through the circles of hell? I don't know. To me, it was the story of a man who has too much talent being used for that talent until it was all gone, and then being tossed aside when it was clear he had nothing left to give. I think that can kind of tell you what the story of the High Table is all about, it's the story of the abuse of man. It tells us how the rich and powerful use people up then stick them in graves with happy go lucky slogans on them. The irony of John Wick is that he knows what he's doing, who he works for, and how corrupt it all is but he doesn't care because he thinks they're all going to end up exactly where he does.\n",

We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.\n",

      "Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!\n",

Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots.

Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective.\n",

In this 4th movie the images and the sets are better but for a grown up, the fight scenes are sometimes hilarious in every way possible. Also, the fact that Caine is blind erases by half his credibility ... a must not have done in my opinion. Thumbs way up for Bill Skarsgard and Shamier Anderson. I don't know if they should have stopped at the third, it is still entertaining but it takes a down slide road of the saga. Not even close to the second, which I think it still is the best of all 4.\n",

      "Review: This fourth chapter adds almost nothing to the John Wick franchise, born somewhat by chance and became a cult narrative for action movie nerds without thickness. The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all...\n",

      "The main drawcard being the action sequences and gunplay. Sadly in chapter 4 they lack any stakes and become boring and repetitive almost instantly. Bullets have no effect or simply pass through people, stuntmen routinely stumble while waiting for their queue to attck then die, basics like taking cover take a back seat to flashy unnecessary spin that some one thought \"looked cool\". Many sequences just look like a bad dress rehearsal they decided to keep.\n",

      "Unnecessary characters that add nothing to the already non existent plot. Streets or famous landmarks are completely empty or filled with bystanders that appear to be in a different dimension, oblivious to the insane acts of violence occurring next to them until it suits the plot or they vanish into thin air from one shot to the next. Not a single police car or officer called out the entire movie. In possibly the most unrealistic scene, an entire subway train in Osaka is empty. This is a movie that holds the same level of quality and planning you'd expect from a bunch of 7 year old boys playing bang bang in their back yard. \"My suit is bullet proof\" you hear them yell as you chuckle and sigh, \"ah kids..\" You really really need to switch off your brain to enjoy this 3hr slog, or just laugh at how poorly planned and executed the entire idea is.\n",

At every action scene, the hench men just stupidly flail around Wick 2 at a time while the other baddies wait behind for their turn, like hello? Realistically, John would be dead within 10 minutes of the movie from a sniper bullet, if the mafia was smart enough to hire one. There was a character who I felt had no purpose in the movie as they had no real effect to the story. This \"tracker\" person kept switching sides between trying to kill and saving John and didn't end up doing anything, poor writing. It just feels as if the majority of the movie was just for show and no substance.\n",

      "Review: John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review\n",
      "\n",
      "John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsgård), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.\n",
      "\n",
      "John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and protégé.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass.\n",

For those who just love seeing homicidal violence, John Wick is your ticket. Particularly for those loving guns and gun violence, this movie is a feast. The dead probably exceeded a hundred, or at least enough to start a decent-sized cemetery. It shouldn't be a surprise that gun violence is so prevalent in the US. As for other aspects of the film, stunts and special effects are impressive. These usually involve killing bad guys and chase scenes. The sets are also impressive in such cities as Paris, New York, Berlin, and Osaka. The plot has minor variations from the good guy - bad guy theme. Why they are good or bad is less obvious. Wick loves his dead wife and personal loyalty seems to matter with the good guys. A much stronger motivator for the bad guys is money and power at all cost. For that, John usually delivers a bullet in the head. I liked Ian McShane and Laurence Fisburne's acting in this movie, but Keanu Reeves seems a bit of a stiff. Caine and Mr. Nobody characters are interesting, mostly because their loyalties are unpredictable and seemingly capricious. All that said, I am not sure how the blind guy can see so well.\n",

      "Review: JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world.\n",

      "Review: Yes, I tried to make a pun out of the word \"Bewildered\" because this film seems like it tried to do just that- make a pun out of the actual John wick films. The first was undoubtedly the best- it was simple, realistic, unintentionally humourous and had a very clear goal. Then, it became a little over the top in the third, especially when he visited the elder and wanted to remain alive just so he \"could remember her\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Huh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I had high expectations walking into the fourth instalment because I do love this franchise. However, it was far too much. The action sequences were shot well and choreographed fantastically but it was unrealistic even for a made believe world. Unless that was what they were going for? More of a Marvelesque/graphic 300 and Sin City- Zac Snyder type vibe? It was no doubt beautiful in terms of Sets, costumes and cinematography and ok, really do have to hand it to the stunt and action choreography team.. if there was an Oscar's category for stunts and fights, they will take it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, no amount of ornaments are going to save a movie with a lack of story. The acting here and dialogue delivery is pretty weak... I was also confused with the motivation. I understand Winston and John's friendship but then again, why is he so hell bent on surviving? John hates the trade, he's out then he's in, then he's in with such a goal to survive but for what reason? So then he's back in and wanting to die ...with honour? It seems out of character to want to get people he cares about involved and die for him and he doesn't even know why he wants to live so bad and run from the high table ... then later, he's in the game again to take revenge for his Japanese friend but then doesn't end up avenging him in the end, the guys daughter had to do it herself. Look, I want to say something prolific and sound like a great movie critic but I'm not. So I'm going to just jump in here into the sea of 9s and perfect 10 reviews and hope I can land like John wick after rolling down 20 flights of stairs and not die.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually went into micro sleep at the 2hr mark because it was too much action. I know, it's crazy. But I woke up because an old couple had to pass me as they were walking out. They shook their heads, I think they were ready for some quiet tea and snacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, you know what peeves me, is that john travels from Osaka to new York then to some other paris and no one kills him on the plane or even the airport? In air, there's no where to go, they would defo be able to kill him in the airplane toilet of even disguise as a hot flight attendant and spike his drink. Also, the blind guy is better than so many other assassins... also, they used the same freaking dog antics as Halle berry but with a black guy that's randomly introduced for fan service or something. Also, i totally saw it coming at the end, as if John will kill Donnie yen. But then they went back to the black guy while he's sitting there drinking beer with his dog and he's like \"that was good/smart\" and I'm like \"whut, no it's nhat\".\n",
      "\n",
      "And like if you love your dog, you wouldn't be feeding it beer.. hello?\n",
      "\n",
      "Then also, John fell from buildings and got shot up and is almost immortal. But at the end he just dies from a gunshot wound in his liver with no will to live. He says \"Winston, take me home\", then Winston is like \"yea ok\". But he doesn't even run after him, he just lets John walk down the steps and he dies. But like now he has no will to live? I thought his goal was to live to remember her. If anything, this should've happened in John wick 2, where he gives in after avenging his puppy and getting his car back, then should lie in the sunset to die and reunite with Helen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Argh but nope he \"dies\". But then the Lionsgate production team realised what a hit this installment was and decides to do a number 5 and 6. So I guess John faked his death and then now comes out of hiding wants to avenge Donnie Yen or the Samurai dude, then they introduce jet li or Jackie Chan and omg it's going to be real Expendables type thing, brainless popcorn flick where everyone just fights real good fight scenes with explosions and falls, fire, snow ice and stuff, lots of injuries, cuts, bloods, 10000 stunt extra deaths, but the main guys limp but still fight with 100% blows and no one dies. Then the ending finally the bad guy has a real dramatic death with flowers and slow music and then John wick is like struggling but saves the day and says \"yeah\".\n",

      "Review: The long-awaited John Wick 4 took a while, but it's finally here. Previous films left the story a little aside to focus much more on the action scenes and with this new release they have taken that even further. The story is simple, it works well, but it's not the main focus. The choreography is wonderful and all the fight scenes are different from the others, which makes them not so tiring. The pace is very frantic and that's wonderful, because it's almost three hours of film. At the beginning it is a little tiring and in fact they could be faster, but the rest is impeccable. Like its predecessors, this is not a masterpiece of cinema, but it works very well as an action film with incredible scenes.\n",

      "Review: First one was good, 2nd was better and really good. Third was the best, so I thought, it's going the right direction.. I couldn't be more wrong.. First of all, what made the previous movies so great and especially the third one, was the details in the action scenes were so accurate.. All of the sudden in the beginning of the hotel in Japan, John wick kept shooting without reload, until he was alone there doing the shooting..? At the end as well.. 21 bullets in his gun. It seemed more.. Also again in so many movies lately, why exagérating so much and making scenes so long, especially during some dialogues.. You know what they're gonna say or what's coming.. And when he fell down the stairs at the end. That was so over the top and unnecessary and so unrealistic.. He had 8 minutes to climb those 222 steps or so, whilst kicking everybody's ass. 3 minutes to go and down he goes all the way to the bottom and start over, crawl back up, little dialogue with Donnie y'en and make it both in time..?? The director said he had to make movie this long to tell the story. That's not true at all. Story wise, it had no positive effect. He just put in more and longer action scenes.. Total let down when you compare it the previous movies. And very predictable also at some times.. This movie wasnt worth waiting so long and definetly not my money..\n",

      "Review: It's worth watching for the action and visuals but some scenes seem totally pointless and done just for the visuals. It is the same story of the last of the two movies. Way too long! No action movie should be over two hours. I prefer a film that felt too short. My mind was wondering during fight scenes. Reeves acting is very stale in this one. He is mostly given one word responses to everything. In a three hour movie his dialog is about a paragraph. Nothing really beats the first film. Proving you don't big budgets and flash to make a great film. It is also if fans will appreciate this ending. I didn't care for it but don't want to spoil it for you.\n",

I saw all of the previous John Wick movies in there theaters. I walked out of each one truly entertained and satisfied. For me, a good movie keeps me entertained and guessing what will come next. Sadly to say, this was the first John Wick movie when I said to myself, \"how many gun fights are there,\" in this movie. I actually thought it was a little too much in this last film. The action is non-stop but it all just seemed to be the same thing. Wish there was a little more to the plot. This is not the way I would have ended the franchise.\n",

Bill Skarsgard has obviously cornered the market playing creepy baddies, and his Marquis was wonderfully understated yet menacing. Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown (THE KERGAN!), and Donnie Yen all delivered in their respective roles as erstwhile allies or opponents.

In JW 3 Hayley Berry and the two outrageous canines nearly stole the whole movie. Having said that with no Keanu there is no John Wick. The succession of bad guys is stunning they are all first class. It was sad to have the wonderful John Reddick pass away in real life which effectively removes a much appreciated support actor as the Continental Hotel Consierge and Ian Mcnees friend. This round of John Wick will be nearly impossible to top in the form of JW 5 if there is to be one. The ending this time does lend itself to a No 5. Drill down you will see that.

Literally hundreds of assassins sacrifice themselves stupidly on John Wick like they've never heard of him and of course, they all get mowed down like cannon fodder. The fight scenes are no longer meticulous but rather average with repetitive moves, stuntmen waiting to get hit/killed, people entering timely in small groups like it's a video game with increasing difficulty. And to lower the urgency even more, bullets are no longer an issue since they all wear \"bulletproof suits\" that makes bullets bounce off like cotton balls, so now they can shoot A LOT more and it doesn't matter.\n",

If you enjoy it more that's great. But Wick falls off three to seven story buildings. He's shot, stabbed, hit by cars!! But he has a bruise and limps so it's super realistic.
