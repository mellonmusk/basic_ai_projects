6,"Decent film. Although suspend belief is needed with alot of John Wick scenes they pushed it too far passed absurd on two occasions.

Two bits were just too annoying to let go. How can a blind man be accurate with a hand gun? Manic fight scenes where no way a blind man could sense enough too shoot and especially a pistol duel at 30 paces each. I can relate to being an amazing martial artist and swords man, but not a crack shot with a gun.

Two the German night club fight scene with hand axes, and initially gun shots. Dancers continued the most awful dancing whilst people where shot and then were being killed with axes next to them. A man died with an axe thrown at him hitting him in the head, between 2x dancers, and falls dead at the feet of 8x dancers but they show no signs of worry and carry on dancing. Only at the end after 20 odd people had died did they react and run away."
8,"This time around the spectacle of death has very high production values in every respect, and once again, they manage to go above and beyond the previous with the set pieces and wild action. It's very long, but every time it started to feel that way, another would emerge that made me forget about the runtime.

However. Where the first two really excelled was in building out the world. The first one was mythological in nature and sets it a bar above and apart, and the next used that to create an interesting underworld. As they've gone on, that aspect has gone away, but by bit. We are firmly in pretty mindless action that stands apart in the way things are shot and the other production aspects. That's all fine, but it does feel slightly sad to leave the most interesting cerebral aspects of the films too, I think. Even if the action movie has evolved into these, which excel above and beyond."
6,"I loved the first John Wick. It was a nice, simple, tight story with *great* action sequences that worked really well and revitalized a genre in a way we haven't really seen since Die Hard. The sequel was mostly more of the same but because they could smell the money making potential if they managed to turn this into a major franchise they started to layer on some more world-building details and lore. I didn't like it as much as the first movie but it was still good fun. The third movie is where this franchise started to lose me - sure, the action was still great for the most part, but the believability was starting to slip a little and all the lore they kept adding was beginning to feel more than a little absurd. Now, with this fourth movie... I'm really starting to think the writers just love the smell of their own farts. This franchise is so far up it's own... *ahem* posterior - that I don't think they can even see where they're going next. The action sequences are still very well choreographed and look great - but action sequences alone do not a movie make.

I would happily rewatch the first John Wick - it was and is a fantastic movie. I have no desire to ever rewatch any of the sequels and am probably done with this franchise at this point."
2,"That the reviews might reflect that this 'chapter' was better than the ones before that i'd watch for...maybe a half hour before either walking out of the theater(one of the benefits of having a monthly subscription to a theater chain. I don't have to sit through a bad movie because i paid for it) or...turning it off. And the reviews were right. I lasted almost forty minutes for this one. I COULD say, 'maybe it's because i'm old', that THAT's why an empty movie like this franchise churns out doesn't appeal to me...and many rave reviewers here wrote about 'the action...the action...the action'. But, as far as I'M concerned, even THAT was ridiculous....unless Wick lives on a lead diet, because in the last scene i watched, where he's on his way out of the Osaka Continental, someone missed him at close range(like 2 feet away, tops?) with an automatic rifle spitting out who KNOWS how many rounds a second? Please. With all the money that's pumped into a movie like this, they SHOULD be able to do better. Yes. The locations were beautifully filmed, hence the two stars. But i really question the mentality of anyone who would want to see this ridiculous excuse for a 'GREAT...the BEST...the absolute BEST' action adventure...by the way...did you like that imitation?"
2,"John Wick Chapter 4, the latest installment in the action-packed franchise, sadly fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. While the series has always been known for its relentless action and stylish cinematography, this particular entry falls short in several key areas, leaving fans and audiences feeling unsatisfied.

One of the major flaws of John Wick Chapter 4 is its excessive nature. While the previous films struck a fine balance between thrilling action sequences and a compelling narrative, this installment seems to have prioritized mindless violence over meaningful storytelling. The film bombards viewers with an overwhelming amount of action, to the point where it becomes tedious and numbing rather than exciting. The absence of a well-structured plot is keenly felt, and it's disappointing to see the movie rely solely on its action sequences without offering substantial character development or engaging dialogue.

Moreover, the film suffers from a lack of innovation and fresh ideas. The franchise has always prided itself on pushing the boundaries of action cinema, but John Wick Chapter 4 feels like a rehash of familiar themes and set pieces. The choreography, while undoubtedly impressive, lacks the innovation and creativity that made the previous films stand out. It becomes apparent that the filmmakers have relied too heavily on the formula that worked in the past, resulting in a stagnant and repetitive experience.

Another issue with this installment is the overwhelming presence of gratuitous violence. While violence has always been a part of the John Wick series, Chapter 4 takes it to an extreme level that becomes tiresome. The constant barrage of brutal and gory scenes can be off-putting and may alienate viewers who seek more substance and depth from the film.

Despite its shortcomings, John Wick Chapter 4 does have its moments. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a committed performance as the titular character, showcasing his physical prowess and charisma. The film also features some visually stunning moments, thanks to the talented cinematography team. However, these positives are overshadowed by the film's lack of a compelling narrative and excessive reliance on mindless violence.

In conclusion, John Wick Chapter 4 disappoints as it fails to live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors. The excessive action, lack of originality, and gratuitous violence detract from what could have been another thrilling entry in the franchise. Die-hard fans may still find enjoyment in the film, primarily due to Keanu Reeves' performance, but for those seeking a well-rounded and compelling cinematic experience, this installment falls short."
5,"A movie completely lacking of a storyline yet with a play time of 2h 45m.

The main character is shot hundreds of times at close range and yes we know he is wearing a cevlar suit, so do his enemies... and nobody thinks to aim for the head ?? And his enemies are wearing body armor yet are all killed with a single shot mr Wick is hit by speeding cars at least 6 times in 20 minutes, and unless i am mistaken cevlar doesn't protect against broken bones yet he gets up and walks away every time... even after falling from a 3rd story window onto a parked car and onto the street he gets up and walks away.

And last but not least he falls down 220 stairs and still gets up like nothing happened and climbs those stairs again

Come on! At least try to make it a bit credible A 5.5 at best."
9,"John Wick series have always been over-the-top action / thriller joyrides more focused on dazzling you with visceral, expertly choreographed action sequences than trying to tell the most coherent stories about stylish assassins. Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember ! John Wick has fought hard for it."
6,"Overall a decent yet deeply flawed and the weakest entry in the franchise. An utterly unnecessary and bloated running time with slow pacing storytelling that bored the crap out of me. The admittedly jaw-dropping and creatively impressive action sequences grind on for so long that they become borderline tedious. This one had too much style but not enough substance, courtesy of the convoluted screenplay and messy direction. Also I didn't liked some of the performances, especially Bill Skarsgård, because he didn't had any character development and his accent was off-putting. The stunt they pulled with that outrageous post-credits scene is like a middle finger to the audience. There better be a follow-up in the sequel.

On the positive side, this movie is packed with stunning visuals, eye-popping cinematography, stellar locations + set pieces, brilliant music and impressive worldbuilding for an original IP.

This movie is a reminder to all the major film studios that you don't need $200 million+ to make epic looking movies (that most of 'em turns out to be VFX monstrosity), you'll only need $100 million and real passionate + talented people behind the screen to create epic level of action spectacle with mostly practical effects and on location shooting without the over-reliance on CGI and green screen."
10,"Sometimes when you have high expectations for a movie, probably you could be disappointed. However this new chapter on the John Wick saga takes you into a new dimension of action. Some of these action sequences are very original, you can note a hard work to make a difference respect other action movies. The electronic soundtrack is an excellent complement for the action. I recommend to see the movie in a IMAX cinema, this way you'll experience all the action details and the amazing sound. I usually see movies on IMAX and I call tell you the John Wick sound is absolutely amazing respect others movie in the same format."
10,"Loved the movie. Was dying to see this and movie didn't dissapoint. Post-credit scene could lead into a spin-off, but I think that issue will be resolved in ""Ballerina"". John Wicks death was unexpected and I don't really think he died. Even though the movie was long, it didn't feel empty. Always something going on. Also loved the characters. Bill Skarsgård portraid his character perfectly. A little dissapointed that concierge didn't get much screen time. ( Rest in peace Lance Reddick ). Overall I say go watch the movie in your free time. 10/10 definetly go see it in ur local cinema. For sure rewatching in a month or two."
4,"How bad can fight scenes be?

It depends - they can be poorly done, or they can be poorly implemented into the movie.

In this case, it's a bit of the former, and all of the latter.

More specifically - the fight scenes have a few seconds of brilliance here and there, but in general they are mediocre, repetitive, and drawn out to the point of becoming boring halfway through each of those scenes.

Filming and editing are equally uninspired, only doing the basic task of capturing stereotypical action choreography and worn out effects.

Even worse, the action gets in the way of what little story there is; this film has moments when a coherent and convincing tale is showing through - like there's an actual movie, desperately trying to get out.

But to no avail; inevitably yet another endless tedious action scene will have you reach for the forward key.

Many missed opportunities, like the brilliant idea of that one 'unique' hitman, which then was so poorly executed.

Action movies, fight scenes, they've been mastered ages ago; of course by many of the better martial arts movies from the East, or Western films like Kill Bill.

What they have in common is a sense for proportion, balance, timing and rhythm - this flick only piles one cheap thrill on top of another, and another, and so on to the point of exhaustion.

It's unfortunate the creators chose to completely abandon the recipe of the first two John Wick movies, which were very decent.

On a positive note: John Wick 3 was even worse re. All of the above; but a heavy dose of confirmation bias might have made the creators of this sequel ignore its predecessors' obvious shortcomings."
9,"Dude I just saw this film last night and it was absolutely phenomenal. The fight scenes were so cool especially the shotgun dragons breath scene where the camera is looking down into the building and follows Wick from above as he lays waste lol. It was a little bit dragged out though. I liked it don't get me Wrong but I think it would've worked completely fine had it be 2hrs30mins in runtime. Some of the fight scenes give you a beat to relax then start back up. The whole Osaka Continental fight scene was so cool with the arrows. Donnie Yen is a beast too. Especially in the Osaka scene. My only gripe with the film, which I understand at Keanus age and stunts can be taxing, is him phoning in his performance. Even with the first Wick film he was more animated. Especially in his movies before then. Like look at the first matrix even and then put his performance here aside it. You'll see he had more emotion back then. Yeah you can say it's ""the character"" but even with the latest Bill and Ted as well as Matrix 4, he seemed to be phoning them in as well. So idk but regardless I would see this movie in theaters. IMAX would be best."
6,"""John Wick Chapter 4"" has stellar style (thru director Chad Stahelski (director of the franchise's first three - and nothing else)) with all its polished neon-lit darkness... but thru relatively new writers Shay Hatten & Michael Finch its content is terribly weak. Titular outcast assassin Keanu Reeves clunks thru an interminable 3hr series of laughably implausible fight sequences (aided by the likes of Lawrence Fishburne & Ian McShane) to get to an ultimate showdown (set by Clancy Brown) with global crime syndicate lead representative Bill Skarsgård (good) - and aside from the odd change of allegiance, that's it. Tho amazing looking, it's a disappointing finale to a fine series."
8,"Given the sad state of Hollywood output these days, this is one of the better offerings. But it does require some suspension of disbelief. You have to believe that 58 year old 175 lb Reeves is a dangerous man. And that sorta works. You also have to believe that this franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-retirement from Asian films was really a good idea? And the writers have stolen tropes and tricks from a handful of prior productions including KUNG FU (wise sayings); MY NAME IS NOBODY; VANISHING POINT (radio overlay); THE BLIND SWORDSMAN; THE GAUNTLET; and of course the first 3 movies in the series. The one quote that best applies here was left out of the script -- ""in the realm of the blind, the one-eyed man is King"". ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer."" Please check out my list ""167+ Nearly-Perfect Movies (with the occasional Anime or TV miniseries) you can/should see again and again (1932 to the present))"
7,"I'll try not to sound like a broken record here and give it to you straight. This movie is about excess. What does that mean? Well for starters, the gun violence here is non stop. The lighting, maximalist like few films would even dare to attempt. Keanu Reeves says things like ""yeah... I'm gonna need a gun"". If that sounds boring, skip this one. If that sounds like a fun time, this is the film for you. Don't overthink this chapter of the story or this franchise. This is about Keanu Reeves beating and shooting everyone in his path. Really enjoyed the Asian martial arts included in this one. Oh and those location were awesome. Skarsgard's character is a cartoon, but hey, isn't that the point? I think so."
2,"John Wick 1 was the best imo. The story was somewhat coherent and drew attention. There was plenty of action that was exciting without being over-the-top ridiculous.

Next up in John Wick 2, the story was still somewhat coherent and though some scenes started to become a bit nonsensical(tons of assassins and no police etc), it was still a solid movie and easy to follow.

In John Wick 3 everything took a nosedive into utter nonsense. Part 4 expanded on this with nothing but lots of ridiculous wild nonstop fights. Typical Hollywood cash grabs devolved into absolute boring and ridiculous rubbish."
10,"Wow, just wow. An absolutely amazing piece of cinema, while realism is on a slight detour, it doesn't detract from the sheer brilliance of the John Wick universe, from start to finish it had me in awe, the lighting, the stages, action, etc. Everything about it was everything a movie should be. There's nothing I can write that could even compare to actually watching it. Exploring more of the world it has built up in the previous entries. Unlike most franchises these days, where more titles come out that gradually gets worse. This is the other end of such a spectrum, it gets better and better with each new entry, always adding something new. The epitome of creativity and cohesion."
4,"I was looking forward to watching the final instalment of this movie series. Sadly, it did not deliver. Not a patch on the first two films or even the third. The fight choreography seemed stilted and slow. I found it so boring that I had to watch it in three sittings. It was like watching someone play a shoot-em-up video game and you know how boring that is to watch. It was exactly the same. Even a couple of the fight scenes looked like something off Tekken (people dancing in the background) and the top down view was also reminiscent of a video game. There was no plot to this thing other than rewards for killing John Wick. The ending was such an anti-climax. Don't bother."
9,"Its as much of a John Wick film as a John Wick fan could wish for.

Very cool and moody.

Very similar to the first three movies but longer, much longer.

Loads of fight scenes - a ridiculous amount - one becomes immune to them after a while. It takes the ridiculous and then goes further. But thats what John Wick is - ridiculous fights, against ridiculous odds.

This one is mostly played seriously. Towards the ends there were some intentional jokes and some bits where the audience laughed at the ridiculousness of it all.

Hopefully this is the last one - it feels like its run its course, fun though its been."
3,"The 1st movie was epic because it was well thought out, the storyline had no loophole, you understood why each character did what they did & left the cinema satiesfied

The camera did a wonderful job in blending the choreography of gun-fu & the ending was satisfactory.

Chapter 2 still had some juice in it but, I knew then that chapter 3 is not on my cinema watching list.

As soon as I saw it, I said to myself this is as what fast n furious 9 is to the whole FF-franchise. Pointless, no storyline, just more layers to a live action future console game idea

Chapter 4 to me would have done great if we got to see who the high table is, how Baba yaga was born, how he retired, how he met & lost his beloved wife & then we get to see how bad ass the high table, is perhaps send it's best & yes get to see wick die.

My problem with this film is how you can clearly see that the actors are fighting a choreographed dance.

No one shoots when Wick is out of ammo, no one attacks when wick is busy with an opponent.

Wick fights for over 20mins in a public space & there is no police reaction.

He hasn't ate since chapter 2 & has fallen off building, hit by cars, lost fingers & never slept But still, take out an entire mob of amatuers & what's worse is how he acts like he is mimicking John wick when he is John wick ""YEAH""

I hate the fact that everyone breaks code & rules when wick is right under their nose, they waste time, make silly mistakes or have their livelihood destroyed

We where told the high-table has top tier contractors but they send a spoilt brat. Lyk wtf? How is he even their best choice

Don't get me started on the blind guy, I knew he was just a male version of the mute lady in chapter 2 The idea was fair but he was just too much, even daredevil can't do what the guy did.

So much stuff was just ridiculous I thought wow this is the worst wick

& lo everyone is screaming it's the best thing in Hollywood right now."
6,"I feel exhausted after watching this endless succession of firefights and fight scenes.

The storyline never felt fresh. On the contrary, it felt sort of an expanded and refitted rehash of Parabellum. And Parabellum was lots of fun and felt like a great cinematic experience because aside of endless and well-choreographed fighting scenes it continued and followed an engaging story woven through 2 previous episodes. But I felt like part 4 just recycled some things from the previous entry of the saga and tried to stretch the bubble gum just a bit too much.

Besides, I thought Lawerence Fishburne and Ian McShane were to play a greater role here but in the end they were there just for the fan-service value.

All in all it seemed like John was out there killing for the sake of killing for 3 straight hours. Period. And I cannot fully convey my astonishment at this world of Parisien NPCs that cannot be bothered by the thunderous sound of blazing bullets and the corpses piling up on the roads at a busy street or in the early hours of the morning near one of the main touristic attractions of Paris. Does anybody live in those places? Nahhh... Duels and events organized by criminal organizations can take place everywhere, anytime without any people showing up or giving two-pence about any bloodshed taking place around them. Seems like Police disappeared out of the face of planet Earth."
8,"Watching this film is like drinking a fine wine that tastes like a spicy Bloody Mary. The impressive feat of the fourth film of a film franchise being this good is unheard of. Not only is it good, it may be the best one yet. Everything that I loved in the first three films are brought here, but the story and layers is so deep, the characters are legitimately compelling. The stakes keep getting raised, the tension tightens as the films progress. Violence is still just as brutal as the first. I'm feeling emotional towards some of the characters outside of John Wick which means the side characters are really good. And yet all of this began after a foolish child killed Wick's dog. However at this point, it's gone beyond just a revenge tale. Now, it's all about survival, the insurmountable obstacles John Wick has to endure to achieve ultimate redemption and finally peace. That's why these films work, because we are all still routing for Wick to make it through and maybe find solace. With that said, the things that also work have to do with Stahelski's amazing direction for someone who was a stuntman is very impressive. Reeves has embedded this character into his own being so much it's now so iconic for him much like what Indiana Jones did for Harrison Ford. Donnie Yen comes in and steals all the scenes he's in, and a great addition to the Wick franchise, creating even more possibilities of where this can go. Clancy Brown makes a welcomed appearance and make the most of his screen time like the true veteran actor he is. Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne complete the cast of solid side characters and both give great performances in this as well. The only reason why this has an 8/10 is because of the runtime. The other films were short and sweet and were effective without the long runtime. This did feel like it dragged on at parts. Nothing that derailed the whole thing or anything, but broke some of the momentum the film built up but luckily the great scenes brought me right back. I'd also like to pay my condolences to Lance Reddick who passed away way too soon. I will remember him for his great scene in the first John Wick film, and he will be missed."
5,"Im more of a story/plot type of audience and this was just action packed, throw the storyline right out the window type of movie.

Action junkies...this ones for YOU!

At any rate, this was absolutely horrible writing. For the last 3 Wicks, every decision just brought him back to square one. Its an endless loop. A writers nightmare when you dont have a story that progresses.

Where this really shines is the cinematography, and fight choreography. Stunning work by the everyone on the crew. Pretty amazing the type shots they were able to get in and had some really good one shots. The fights scenes are awesome but just kinda got old when the movie is nearly 3 hours long.

Entertaining film... would def say it was worth the money."
9,"For starters, you are here because you saw the 3 parts and now want to know if 4th was worth making. And I here, guarantee it was worth every paise/penny.

This is not just a killing machine movie like 3 others, this one promises some emotions, which is, on repeated basis, broken with a action sequence.

Donnie Yen, as it goes, gives everything behind his kicks, but I wish he did that in this. He was outstanding but, the way I love to see him was missing, yeah well that's my problem.

Action sequences, the stairs one in the end, was so perfectly filmed, I was wanting that sequence to not end at all. Marvelous.

The weary but focused John Wick is ready to 'Kill'em all' and he almost did. But, I won't say much, go watch this."
6,"A fourth JOHN WICK!?!? 🤔🤔🤔... really?!!

Some scenes should have had more story and MORE characters from past JOHN WICK chapters returning for a final play or collaboration.

I understand why movies are usually done in x3, work better!

I REALLY started to watch less & less of the ""Gunfighting"" scenes & looked for more story. Because making sense of where this story was going was starting to irritate me!

YES the gunfights are good & some of the fight was good also... BUT at least fight in a manner that makes sense rather than draw it out just for show! Fighting needs purpose & understanding in fighting. Like quick, no muck around ready for the next bullet & knife coming in one's direction.

I liked chapter4 JOHN WICK, just lesser & lesser with time."
9,"The John Wick Franchise has changed and evolved throughout the years but the 4th installment in the series beats it's predecessors in literally every possible way. John Wick Chapter 4 combines all the components of its predecessors, but better. It delivers staggeringly choreographed action sequences, a mesmerizing climax with such visual and auditory style that it has set up new standards for action films moving forward. The characters were all pretty interesting and enjoyable with Keanu Reeves and Donnie Yen particularly killing it.

The story was mostly well written and pretty well thought out which at times feels like a video game quest. Though the film's nearly 3 hour runtime can drag a bit but it's easily excusable with so many other great stuff happening on screen.

The Cinematography was probably the highlight of the movie. This movie is filled with so many beautiful and vibrant shots along with such amazing set pieces which makes it even more engaging to watch. Absolute eye candy.

With this film, Chad Stahelski has proven to be one of the best action filmmakers of our time. Marvel better take notes."
10,"Go to the bathroom before the movie because if you leave during you ""will"" miss something for sure.. Its John Wick on Steroids!!! And when you think you know what's happening next(other than another few hundred deaths) it takes a turn, again and again. Lots of stories inside the main story. Keanu is well great. And all the characters are there along with the whole host of new characters that spice up the stories, inside the story. There are some chuckles when you need them the most so you can exhale and take a fresh breath scattered throughout the film. Oh yea stay until the end of the credits!! Enjoy."
7,"Too long great finale not as good as 1-3 John Wick if comparable in entertainment wise didn't have the necessary amount of great dialogue to give good breaks to very well choreographed long action sequences.

However the action is ultimately what it's all been about as one is left with a myriad of questions into the mythology and other characters from 2 & 3 that leave some people like myself with some frustration.

My primary question in 3, is that after 2 there was tremendous significance placed on the marker with equal emphasis on the infallibility of the High Table.

You have Sontino D'antonio utilizing a marker to eliminate his sister who is member of the high table. You have Winston keeping a ledger of the marker...

Now there is nothing in 3 definitely not 4 that resolves this issue leaving the viewer to come up with their own hypothesis to fit into the events.

The high Table not the Gamorah come after John after Santino is deservedly slain- yet he is rewarded for sanctioning the hit on his sister? We know a record of markers and currencies are part of the neutral ground and sanctuaries of the continental chain of hotels. One wonders why Winston did not bring this up during his adjudication.

Possibly-The high table perhaps then saw her assassination as an internal dispute as to who should be at the seat belonging to them but why would that justify Sontino taking out a 7 million dollar contract on Wick.

Perhaps since Santino was killed without an order it is viewed differently the contract is out of territories belonging to that family and is seen as disrespectful to the table. It's a tight fit but grants it coherence. If approached more strategically perhaps Mr Wick could have had the Santino bounty removed and left him to be dealt with on the level of the table. Taking his rightful anger out and doing so in the continental does threaten the structure. For the type of film I can be fine with that.

Now after three you're left to wonder what's the deal with Angelica Houston & Halle Berry. Halle Berry I assume is pardoned at the outset because of the marker, Her old boss may be under no obligation to kill him but it's his discretion ok... but then she creates her own problem by having her dog attack him, and she blows his knee cap what's her status?

At the opening of this film one assumes that the previous elder is deposed for underestimating or misreading John, and perhaps being unaware of the amount of influence Winston has over John leading to a debacle. One can assume the adjudicator is dealt with as the concierge and Winston were.

The end of three one assumes the ""Bowery King"" though operating more independently still cannot defy the table...would be the mastermind for John Wick but he's not very involved.

Why this Marquis guy the one to take charge- why does his #2 speak Spanish not French- and what accent is the Marquis using because it's a terrible French.

The open contract has competition killing each other for 25 million making John's chance of survival more realistic. Not very logical in terms of the Table unless they're sadistic power players pitting underlings against each other.

It's true that John is ""addicted to the vengeance"" is a man with nothing to lose, and once Helen died if not his dog or car unless he met another would have found some other reason to relapse.

If John wanted to survive he merely could have disappeared after falling off the roof....he didn't go for Winston nor does it indicate that he planned on it and that would have been the only unsettled score for John.

Taking on the Table was motivated by Winston. Continuing after the roof could be a debt to the Bowery King for saving his life and getting him back to health maybe or just John's own death wish but with a desire to destroy the establishment in doing so.

The dialogue exchanges in the first three were significantly more entertaining than in this installment outside of the card game in Berlin.

What this movie had over the third was the cinematography and scenery. This installment was designed to be appreciated from an IMAX screen.

It's clear 30 minutes in that the ""story"" really ended at the end of Chapter three.

Had they made the ""Resistance"" and Laurence Fishburne more integral, it might have given the film more substance.

This movie should be ""The Finalization of the Table"" because it was about John from their perspective not from his own.

I was frustrated having to wait for a fourth they didn't turn it into Alien or Rocky thank goodness, but waiting 3.5 years for what was purely a visual wonder. Excellent choreography music etc... but the characters and story were pretty much completed in Chapter 3. The dialogue was repetitive since the fist film.. ""We're both damned"".....""Thinking you can change who you are & lying to yourself"" etc....

Every dialogue sequence in Parabellum was significantly better from ""Tick tock Mr Wick""....to ""How can one burry the Ocean""......""You gave John Wick 7 bullets your punishment is seven cuts"".... ""John...your exhausted, tired, clearly in pain and you still killed all my students...If I didn't have to kill you we could be friends""...That was primarily what I found missing from this final istallment... outside of exchanges in Osaka & the Berlin Card game, you didn't have sufficient satisfying breaks to not feel that the final action sequence was tiring."
8,"Miss the sound of a police sirene in the background, when sinking deeper and deeper into the gloomy afterlife of an overkill session. John wick is the phantom of the modern day, not the bengaly one living in the caves of skulls, cause he will survive and will endure an eternal life, therefore be ready for number 5.

It seems to me that theyve learned some fighting coregraphics from the south korean action film making, well set and done, but its made and filmed in an awful kind of darkness, thats hiding more than revealing the consequence of life and death and the quality of the acts.

So until theyve taught mr wick to walk, as for now it seems like hes got a candle light up his spina iliaca caudata, he will always appear like phil lynott's ''im a just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail''. And when that day comes i might consider. Keanu reeves an actor for the real hall of fame. I liked the action, but the script is dry as the horn of africa. Wonder how the playbook looks like. Anyway a recommend from the grumpy old man."
1,"The movie has action scenes that are just over the top and ridiculous. The movie would be more effective if the action scenes were more realistic. I'm not sure how anyone can get into a gunfight with around 100 people and not take a hit. The dialogue has alot to be desired and the plot itself was just silly. I wish I could recommend the movie, but I can't. I haven't seen the rest of the franchise movies, but will have to check out the first one as they tend to be the best and sequels tend to get steadily worse. So if you're looking to watch mindless action and violence, then this movie will be for you."
7,"No spoilers, just to say that it is worth a watch for action fans. Plot is weak, the film is really just a sequence of very long drawn out and unrealistic fight setpieces....which nevertheless are well shot. Unrealistic because the skill with which every single fighter in the movie (and there are literally hundreds if not thousands of them) can dodge bullets is ridiculous. Suffice to say, the ratio of gunshots on target at close range (within 1-2 metres) is about 1 in 10. Either the fighters are impossibly good at dodging bullets or else they have become so adept at unarmed combat that their gun firing skills have become nonexistent."
7,"John Wick Chapter 4 was one of the most awaited sequels of 2023. After what happened at the end of Chapter 3, I was interested to know what will happen next.

The movie was fully action-packed like the previous installments but the action scenes were more intense this time. The story was a simple continuation of the previous part. The performances by all the cast members were good and memorable.

One different and new thing I noticed in this part was that the movie had a lot of emotional elements attached to it. This felt a little bit weird to me as the previous installments only focused on action and nothing else. I faced one more problem and that was the pacing of the movie. The movie felt fast at some moments and slow at other moments, in other words, the pacing was inconsistent. The runtime also felt a little bit long but the overall experience doesn't get affected by it.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was a good entry in the John Wick franchise even after having the same old story."
10,"The best John Wick sequel ever. I didn't expect that to be better than I thought. Almost 3 hours of full action with different action styles in different countries. I have always loved this detail in this series and the previous one. Sometimes you couldn't guess what will happen. Must watch it at a theater.

John Wick series has written its own name with gold letters in the movie industry. When it is released digitally, I would like to finish all of them. You can feel the connection between the first and last. Sequel names are given as ""Chapter Two, Chapter Three, Chapter Four"". These are not a joke. Really a four-part full story."
5,"I guess if you love fight scenes, 3 hours of leaping, grunting and killing is even better than the customary two. For me, it got old and repetitive after hour #1 and I became distracted over and over. The only way to soldier on to the end was to pause and pick it up another day. I can't imagine sitting in a theater and watching the whole predictable story in a single session.

Of course the real distraction was seeing how Keanu had aged. He used to have a perfect radiance about him which kept him untouched through all the horrors he endured. In Chapter 4 it appears his Portrait of Dorian Grey has lost its magic and the effects of his punishing life are worn on his face. He needs to check in with Tom Cruise for make up recommendations."
10,"Most of the franchises after the 2nd movie maybe the 3rd movie they are bad but John Wick, men every movie is better then the previous one. What should I say for this movie? Camera shots? AMAZING. Keanu Reeves? AMAZING. Action? AMAZING. Story? AMAZING. Character development A M A Z I N G. I enjoyed this movie from the beginning until the end and I am very difficult with the movies like this but this one as the most John Wick movie ever probably the best.

Thank you Keanu you are simply amazing in action movies and as a human. I am waiting for the next to one to be even better.

Was a bit long movie but worth it. For me 10/10."
4,"Painful 3 hours watching ridiculous stunts and a weak storyline. I like action movies and thought John Wick 3 was really good, but this is a waste of money and time. Over the top! It feels more like a video game for teens where you need to kill 500 people than an action movie. Not sure why some people rate this so high and give it a 9/8. Maybe the grand locations and the beautiful settings, including the massive club in Berlin are amazing, but the way the movie is told is kind of disrespectful to viewers. Great action movies are not about getting shot over 5000 times, Hit by cars and falling down 400 steps without a scratch!"
3,"Reviews killed this movie so I was expecting more and I was displeased and bored all the time, ending was fine only. 3 hours for this movie is too much and it's only gunshots no talking or storytelling just impossible action scenes. I didn't watch trailer because I saw good reviews and got bored after all. If you guys love movie 3 hours long with no talking with Chuck Norris jokes this is movie for you. Don't Understand people who likes this movie even 70-80s action movies are better but they have bad reviews I guess. 5th movie doesn't need to be filmed at all, it's done he's dead and no need for comeback."
4,"I was looking forward to this. Keanu Reeves is great, and I've a good time with the previous John Wick movies (not so much the 3rd one, but still OK), so what's there not to like, right?

Wrong. Unfortunately. I don't want to go into the potholes, because this is not a documentary or a drama, so let me cut it some slack there right away. However, even with that headstart, things are going downhill quickly.

This is the first time when I have seen John Wick tired, weak or worn. Some of the action scenes look really silly because there is no perceivable force or momentum in John's moves. I'm sure Keanu is in excellent phisical shape, so I don't get it: sometimes it really looks like a grandpa is trying to beat up a bunch of street-kids.

Then the so-much cited world-building...oh well, we needed that as much as a mole needs sunglasses, but still: where did it derail so badly? I mean this is supposed to be a secret society, operating behind the scenes, barely leaving a trace, right? Then how come that armies (literally, small armies, plural) of assassins and henchmen are just swarming in world-famous locations, time after time? How come that there is apparently a ""Continental"" in every major city? That there is always yet another rule, which can be used to move the ""plot"" (man that was difficult to label it such) forward? If you bend the rules (your rules, btw) so many times, why would anyone invest into the characters? If they get in a pickle with seemingly no way out, we just invent another rule (or exception, or amendment, or whatever), and the job's done. It really turns any dramatic potential (not that there are many to start with) into a proper snoozefest.

OK, so not much substance or plot, Mr Wick is not who he once was, and the world building sucks....but the action scenes are still great, right? Well, kind of. Clearly not my taste, but it is evident that a lot of effort went into creating them, so I can perfectly understand if some of the viewers find them enjoyable. For me, they just went waaay to far. There are so many opponents executed (hundreds, literally), that there is no weight to it. No matter what, the bad guys drop, and John Wick walks away...gets boring after the first 150 killings or so. The complete lack of realism doesn't help, and neither does the fact that they overwrite their own set of rules in an instant if and when they deem fit (example: you can't penetrate the magic armor by bullets, but apparently you can cut and stab through it....come on now, decide already).

With all that being said, the movie does have its moments...few and far in between, yes, but still, sometimes it just does. That however doesn't justify the 3 hours I feel I have wasted watching it: I would have needed a lot more meat on the bone, some better characters, at least a bit of a reasonable plot, and some consistency at least against its own set of rules. To sum it all up, this defintiely feels like the low point of the series, and I honestly don't understand how this, in its current form, got the green light."
6,"Was disappointed with Chap.4! Loved the first three! The almost 3 hr run time didn't bother me BUUUT.....Bill Skarsgard's character wasn't a very convincing villain, Shamier Anderson as the ""tracker"" was really corny, and Weston's over the top tan (LOL) were three things I couldn't get past in this one. Honestly, even though I enjoyed them, there were way too many (and too long) fight sequences in this film that didn't jive well w the bland story line! A 4 hr run time (to balance out all the fight scenes) would've been justified if better dialogue and more convincing main characters (as mentioned above) were present. The tires ran flat to the finish in this franchise!"
3,"I wonder what percentage of the people who are raving about this film are adults. My guess would be a minority. And the adults who love this film are also likely Marvel fans, so they are willing to suspend any need for credibility. I think the aspect I found most offensive, was the arm plates, which ALWAYS stopped incoming bullets, no matter what angle they were coming from, the caliber of the weapon, or any other scientific factor.

This film was very poorly written. The sets, the cinematography, the lighting was spectacular. I only watched it for the production values, having tuned out this franchise after the 2nd film.

The fight scenes were interminably long, and 100 levels beyond preposterous. Most of this film was ridiculous. Very dumb stuff. If you can dumb yourself down, you might enjoy it more than I did."
2,"If you want to see an aging actor move just a bit slower, and his enemies wait to be hit by him, then you're in for a treat! I think audiences are so used to seeing a guy run up to Wick to try and punch him with their gun instead of using it from afar that it no longer looks ridiculous, which it is. Also, apparently, he's bulletproof, and can grab/roll any number of bad guys he wants to.

The movie long climax scene grows old fast as John Wick now has unlimited stamina, can almost never be shot, recovers from all injuries, and is now in God Mode. And as anyone knows, God mode removes any sense of difficulty, suspense, or accomplishment. This movie is a joke. If the protagonist is never in danger, and can never really be hurt, there's no tension or drama. Don't waste your time."
8,"A very different kind of JOHN WICK film that has equal amount of hits as it has misses. As someone who wasnt much of a fan of Chapter-3 this addresses none of my gripes. Too many characters, too many rules/norms/High-table bs, too many bullet sponge cartoonish mob fight, indestructible superhumans and John Wick himself being a cardboard cut-out parody version of himself. I mean yeah it has some cool actions scenes, especially the Hotline-Miami esque topdown shooting sequence and almost every scene with Donnie Yen but does it erase all the overkills? What made the first 2 films so great was that JOHN WICK actually felt like a human, had emotions. Now its just using the suit as a shield and walk away with literally anything. Also for a movie with action legends like SANADA-SAN, DONNIE YEN, KEANU REEVES there was barely any worthwhile action, I just wanted a showdown with each of them in their prime but the movie infuriatingly shies away from that. For what its worth atleast I'm glad more people are gonna discover RINA SAWAYAMA, she's an amazing artist and got to flaunt her fighting chops as well."
5,"So I was hoping this one was gonna deliver more in terms of story and character but sadly no. All the same beats as before, all the same tropes from the previous films and the only thing holding it together is Keanue and Donnie Yen.

The world of John Wick is a small world, everyone in it is an assassin and that makes assassins mundane and boring. The movie takes place all over the world and characters teleport at a moments notice making the world feel even smaller.

John is not a very interesting character, he was in the first one where we got to know him, but now that we do know him there isn't much going on. His persistence and skill is the only thing interesting about him and that's not enough to carry a movie this long.

The whole ""High table"" thing is so lame. They really don't know what to do with it and now that the series has been all over the world and killed everything that moves 100 times over the threat of the HT is pretty much like being scared of the IRS.

I hope they keep making films with this level of skill and love but for christ sake, put some effort into the scripts!!!"
2,"Does Bill Skarsgård know how to wear a suit or does that man know how to wear a suit? I'm giving the costume designer for John Wick 4 a nice fat ""10"". But the rest of the movie?

Everything bad that can be said about this movie has been said already, by other reviewers. Still, I can't resist adding a few gripes of my own. Forgive me for repeating what other's have already written, but I feel like it's the only way I can get rid of this very bad taste in my mouth.

Keanu I love you with a passion, but you're too old and creaky to come off as someone who is impervious to cars slamming into you at 45mph. The scene where you fall 75+ feet onto a car and walk away like nothing happened? Hahahahaha. Stop it, you're killing me.

And you, with your gray beard, rolling down 222 stone steps ----- ALL the way down the steps, and then AGAIN part way, even though there are multiple breaks in the stairs where (kudos to stunt work!) anyone else would have eventually come to a halt in their rolling? ---- pure comedy.

The fight scenes where the guys WAIT for you to make your move, over and over and OVER again. Beyond painful to watch. The audience can practically see the cartoon balloon over your head reading, ""Okay. Now this is where I insert my left leg in between this dude's legs and I heave myself over, so we twist and, as he falls, he very helpfully throws himself to the side and then he waits for me to shoot him in the head.""

The fight scene choreographers should all die of shame. Is this the best they could do? Time after time the bad guy pulls back and you can almost hear him saying to himself, ""Wait for it. This is where Keanu comes at me, jumps on my chest and then shoots and stabs me. Ready set go!""

Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Lance Riddick, Ian McShane, Larry Fishburne = Great performances. Keanu? Some of the worst of the worst of your acting effort, sad to say. Really BAD.

One last thing: Ian McShane's upper teeth really bothered me. As in mesmerized by their fakeness and fit type bother me. Can't unsee that.

Of course Baba Yaga isn't dead. Pfft. But I sure hope this franchise is. Enough is enough."
8,"John Wick 4 gives it all with its never-before-seen action stunts that will take your breathe... literally. There are some stunts that are fresh from the oven, it's the first time it's been done in the history of filmmaking. The pacing is frenetic and the action sequences are jaw-droppingly awesome, you'll never get enough of them.


A special shoutout to the cinematography team. Every time Mr Wick is punching, kicking, smashing and every other verb you can think of, the cameras have their ways of putting us on a ride; like a curious kid standing close only feet apart watching everything happening before his eyes. It is breathtaking, it is vibrant and it really feels like we're there with John Wick.








However, because there isn't many long-running characters left, it may be a drag for some audience. John Wick 4 isn't the same like the other 3, it is heavier, bloodier, and its neo-noir looks are refined and richer, it'll make you feel you're watching Blade Runner 2049 instead. Some will appreciate its tonal shift but others won't accept the new look, feel and heavy-themed stories.





Verdict: Defining the action genre, John Wick Chapter 4 offers an orgy of violence, nail-biting kinetic action sequences that will set the bar for the rest of the one man army movies in decades to come. It may not be THE best John Wick film but WOW, this is first class entertainment at its finest."
3,"What can I say? It was John Wick.

2 hours 40-ish minutes of over choreographed, gratuitous fighting. Action Action Action. Nothing organic in it, at all. Fighting amongst dancers, fighting in water, fighting with broken glass flying, fighting near traveling automobiles, fighting in abandoned buildings. So creative 🙄 . So the new thing is the Kevlar suits? Ok. Oh, and the shotgun (?) that kills you and lights you on fire 🔥 too...

The only thing that saved the movie even at all for me, is the homage to The Warriors, which was at least interesting and entertaining! Actually, the new dog was great, and his handler character, just meh.

Please don't make anymore. John Wick was SO COOL when it came out, we are way for past that now. It has lost what made it magic."
5,"I'm a big John Wick fan but I really didn't like this installment. I found it really bland and boring.

The main issue was that the stunts felt like they pulled a lot of punches. Almost every action sequence felt numb, like they didn't have any weight or any stakes. Fight scenes would go for far too long and yet leave absolutely no impact. Someone could fall off of a building, shake it off and be totally fine again. There were acrobatics, sure, but it felt like Power Rangers combat.

It also felt like this installment was being crushed under the weight of its own lore. The hints of greater lore and underlying history in the other movies were great, and part of what got me really interested in the continuing franchise. By the fourth installment this has become so all encompassing that it absorbs the whole movie in a convoluted plot of pomp and politics."
3,"Absolutely unmitigated rubbish. The only reason it's worth 3 stars is the cinematography & settings. I'm writing this whilst watching at 90 minutes in. Mr Wick would have killed at least 200 people so far. The killing is at a rate of more than a death per minute. Not bad for a Buddhist assassin.

Then we have the fact that all of other characters in the film are absolute tossers or posers. This film is clearly fantasy, but it is so divorced from reality as to be absurd.

I am disappointed that Keanu Reeves would make this very trashy film. I had believed him to be a fine actor. Money clearly means more than integrity."
8,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action-packed thriller that will certainly please fans of the franchise. The film delivers some impressive fight scenes and great cinematography that is characteristic of the John Wick films. Keanu Reeves once again delivers a solid performance as the titular character, showcasing his impressive martial arts skills and stoic demeanor.

However, the film does feel a bit repetitive in terms of its plot and action sequences. While the action is well-executed, it doesn't bring much that we haven't seen before in the previous films. Additionally, some of the new characters introduced in the film could have been developed more fully.

Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is an enjoyable continuation of the franchise, with some standout moments that will satisfy fans, but it lacks the freshness and excitement of the earlier films. The film earns a 7/10 rating for its strong action, solid performances, and impressive production values."
5,"I was skeptical going into this movie. It is not the masterpiece the rating sites make it out to be. I already hated it when he fell off the building at the end of the third movie. Now he falls off buildings and survives more than once and gets hit by cars multiple times with no damage. Is he a terminator in disguise? Or are we looking at the next Fast and Furious franchise where each movie just becomes more ridiculous?

At the start of the movie, you also have one of the henchmen stopping an arrow with his suit, yet the same arrows can pierce the kill squad's helmets?

I still have no idea what the story is about since about halfway into chapter 3. Does he just need a reason to kill?

If not for the fight choreography, the amazing overhead scene in the apartment, and the silliness of people who want to kill each other conversing peacefully a few times in the movie, I would have given this movie a much lower rating."
8,"John Wick Chapter 4 is another great entry in the franchise, with a few hiccups here and there.

Naturally, the action sequences in this film were spectacular. It is still hard to believe that Keanu, at the age of 58, is still able to perform the stunts on show in this film. There is a great combo of hand to hand, gun combat, sword fighting and some insane action set pieces. Even though some of action does become a bit over the top and drags on too long, it still manages to blow you away.

The production design, cinematography and lighting continue to shine through. The night-life shots and sequences where the colours are accentuated continue to be a visual spectacle.

The film did slack on the narrative front. I felt that John Wick had no clear goal in this movie and was just going from objective to objective, defeating anyone who stood in his way.

Also, as much as I love Keanu, I really did not enjoy his acting. I understand Wick is supposed to be this reserved, almost emotion-less boogeyman, but Keanu just had too many cheesy one-liners. I struggled to take him seriously.

Bill Scarsgard as the Marquis (the main antagonist and villainous representative of the High Table) was okay. His character felt too similar to the The Ajudicator from the previous film.

I really enjoyed Donnie Yen's portrayal as the blind assassin, Caine. His swift, ruthless fighting style really stood out. I also liked the unique relationship he shared with Wick. I also cannot ignore the crazy German kingpin, Killa (Scott Adkins). He was a fun charismatic villian.

I am a big fan of John Wick universe world and the various characters that inhabit it. Therefore, I can say that despite its flaws, John Wick is still a fun and captivating experience which continues to push its action to the next level.

Definitely worth your time!"
7,"This latest chapter of the John Wick saga once again doesn't lack in action sequences. Keanu Reeves (John Wick) brings his incredible ability to stave off hundreds of thugs to reach a climactic showdown with the Marquis (Bill Skarsgard). In a movie like this the storyline is simple, and with the amount of time devoted to action scenes, there is not enough time to develop a deep plot.

Ian McShane (Winston) appears in the movie once again, and always raises those around him with his incredible acting ability.

This is a top notch action movie that will keep your eyes glued to the tv for the entire 2 hours and 45 minutes."
10,"10/10 best movie of the year I will definitely rewatch it on the weekend highly recommend Half of this review will be me gushing about the action. Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow."
9,"If you enjoyed any of the other three, this is a non-stop roller coaster, amped up to 11. It features a lot of catchy and signature lines, delivered in a way that is both cool and cheesy.

The gun-fu is next level, and the addition of Donnie Yen contrasts Reeves's style so well.

It's over-the-top and exhausting, exhilarating and beautifully shot. It showcases the best of Wick's humanity. The cinematography is a cut above the previous entries in the series.

This is one of the few movie franchises that continues to defy expectations and delivers an experience well worth the price of admission.

Stay for the post-credits scene."
10,"Great, once again, join wick movie. Nice views, good vibe, new ideas and this time also better cast opponents. Espescially the French & Berlin actors. Yes.. sometimes the shooting scenes are a bit long and not all the acting is top of the line. But the movie has enough strong moments to counter these issues. A movie that all John Wick lovers would like to see! Hopefully they will continu these type of movie productions. Do get some snacks and drinks ready because it is a long sit. However the pace of the movie is good and will keep you entertainted all the way to the very end. See it in theater!"
2,"I didn't care about any of the characters. The world felt like a slumber dream. What is real, what is not. Action was poorly choreographed. Had no realistic element. I was so tempted to pick up phone or just leave, I've never done either, but also never been so tempted. I think if you are 13 years and this might be action-porn for you. The first John wick was solid, this was not.

There is scene where something happens to John and that was funny. I don't think it was supposed to be funny. But I was too frustrated with whole film. There is scene which shooted from the ceiling and that felt like a game... idc to write anymore."
8,"The ending left me feeling frustrated, empty and just unfulfilled. I feel like I sat through a 3 hour movie... and now 3 previous movies... for nothing. We demand a rewrite. The ending was almost as bad as the last matrix movie. Everything else was fine as far as the storyline goes. How did you think people were going to feel about this/ or react. Like oh my gosh what a wonderful ending.... Now when everyone asks me how the movie was, all I can say is eh, it made me feel worthless at the end. Don't go see it in theater is what I'll say lol Hope it does well after all the bad reviews come out after opening."
8,"Most American action flicks released these days have poor screenplays and overuse computer-generated imagery. The John Wick franchise is one of the few exceptions, along with Mission Impossible. These franchises keep getting better with every entry. Hollywood can make action masterpieces, but Marvel has greater demand, so that's what we get most of. It's a shame.

The stunts and choreography are beyond impressive. Every artist involved does their job to perfection. Donnie Yen's performance is unbelievable. Not only does he fight great, but he also has to move like a blind man. Keanu Reeves is also very impressive. Keanu IS John Wick. Although there are a few scenes where his enemies stand by and wait for their turn to attack, it's easy to overlook because everything else is so great.

I can't fathom how anyone could choose to watch Ant-Man over John Wick. It's so fast-paced, and the choreography and stunts are mesmerizing and brutal. When the action breaks out, it's unbelievable. It's hard to explain -- you have to see it! Why watch a computer-generated ""superhero"" fly around when you can witness Reeves and Yen engage in a genuine and thrilling fight?"
10,"This is a great movice because; stunts are performed by main character. The stunts does not contain fake feel or unrealistic. Other characters were all committed to their roles and they were not feel NPC or extras. Casting and clothing on point. Location of the movie and lights are all great. Camera work and camera motion were all so well done. Background sound and music perfectly matched the scenes.

The narration of the story makes sense and Overall it is worth a high score because of the completion of many things put together well.

Well done to casts and entire crew.

Highly recommending this movie."
3,"The review of siderite is spot on. No plot, no storyline, slow or pointless dialogues. But what irked me the most in the 2.5 hours of the same shooting scenes is that apparently the whole world was filled with NPCs. Imagine going into a club, knifing, shooting or axing 50 people on the dance floor... Yet everybody keeps dancing. Or shooting 50 assassins and destroying 20 cars or the roundabout of the Arc de Triomphe... Yet no police shows up and everybody keeps driving as if there is nothing wrong. That roundabout has troubles digesting normal traffic that don't need to worry about dodging cars, bullets and brain from all of the head-shots. I didn't think the third sequel to the (brilliant) first movie would be worse that the other sequels but the last 2.5 hours of my life proved me wrong."
6,"This franchise, like most of them, tends to just drop with every installment. And I hate to be saying this, since I absolutely loved the first one and really liked John Wick 2. Although, in the second one, there was a glimpse of things to come with unpenetratable suit silliness (Batman thingy..) . In John Wick 3, he falls from skyscraper and lives like a superhero.. Look where we started with original John Wick and where we ended up now. From a good story, rough, dark, believable John Wick, we gradually got another, sorta Marvel, ridiculousness, from everyone wearing ""batman suits"", blind ninja, desert chase on horses, while still wearing same clothes. Yes, this is an action movie, and there's shootings and fights and killings, but it's gotta be proportionate to everything else, no? Here we got 89.9% of fights and a snippets of monologues with five sentences. Time to wrap it up. It was a good ride.. with John Wick and John Wick 2."
8,"Morale of the story, don't mess with anyone's dog. With the price on his head ever increasing, legendary hit man John Wick takes his fight against the High Table global as he seeks out the most powerful players in the underworld, from New York to Paris to Japan to Berlin.

Action, action, and even more action! What I really didn't like about the previous movie was that it was just oriented around the action and the story was just not there. However, we get the best of both parts in this movie. There were so many action scenes and they were all pretty long making them even more exciting and fun. The movie was also visually beautiful. Keanu Reeves as always puts on a great performance especially in the action scenes, in which, by the way, he does approximately all his stunts. The supporting cast was also so good, including the antagonist and the unexpected characters/cameos.

The ending was amazing; very fulfilling, exciting, and shocking. Although it was a fun journey, the 3 hours run time was a bit too long leaving me very drained at the end of the movie.

Score: 8.5/10."
10,"If you're looking for a thrilling action movie, John Wick 4 is definitely the movie series to watch! Everything in this world revolves around rules, and it's been a while since I've seen a movie that captures this concept so well. The direction and use of lighting in the movie is simply phenomenal, and it takes the movie to another level.

There are moments when it seems like the action is over the top, but the movie quickly redeems itself with the next scene. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who loves action movies, as it is an incredible experience from start to finish.

The Continental grounds, the 9mm carbon pistol, crest, rules, and the setting in Japan with the sumo fighters were all executed flawlessly. The costumes, logos, music, dogs, cars, bikes, and horses added another layer of excitement to the movie.

I particularly enjoyed the dragon fire breath gun, which was just plain fun to watch. Overall, this movie series is a thrilling and exciting ride, and I'm looking forward to Lions Gate releasing more seasons and episodes in the future. The artistic direction of the movie series is definitely worth a praise, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a good action flick."
5,"I watched this latest installment of the John Wick killing spree over two nights. I usually don't do that kind of thing, but this movie is rather exhausting. In the old days, they had intermissions in the middle of long movies. But now we're expected to sit through nearly three hours of endless murders. I'm not sure what I was expecting to be different in this one. I liked the first two Wick movies. The third one was less memorable (I had to watch a YouTube summary video of the series to remind myself what had happened in 3) but it was still enjoyable. This one is basically more of the same. John Wick once again has to deal with some euro trash second rate Bond villains in order to regain his ""freedom"". To obtain said freedom, he kills about 250 guys. Maybe more. I lost count. The director stages lots of beautiful backdrops for John to kill people. He kills them in neon drenched Osaka. He kills them in a very wet Berlin rave. He kills a whole bunch in Paris, the city of light, and the city without a single police officer in sight. I know these movies are just ultra violent fantasies, but at a certain point during one of the many parts of John Wick's Paris bloodbath, I felt like I was watching a video game. I'm sitting there watching all this money being spent... so I can feel like I'm watching a video game. Somehow I feel that wasn't the director's intention.

In spite of the addition of the wonderful Donnie Yen (again playing a blind swordsman) and some often incredible production design, JW4 is not the masterpiece that some are claiming it to be. The main problem in all of these movies is, even if John Wick gets his freedom, what would he do with it? Work at Home Depot so he could moonlight as The Equalizer like Denzel? There isn't really anything at stake. There never was, I suppose, but somehow I didn't feel it as much in the other movies. But I definitely felt it in this one. Man, I'm tired of John Wick. Can someone please just kill this guy?"
3,"""John Wick 4"" attempts to continue the high-octane legacy of its predecessors but ends up being a parody of itself. Directed by Chad Stahelski, the film seems to have forgotten what made the franchise captivating in the first place.

#### Plot

The plot picks up where ""John Wick 3"" left off but quickly devolves into a series of absurd scenarios that defy logic. The narrative becomes a comedy of errors, where characters make inexplicable decisions just to move the plot forward.

#### Action Sequences

While the fighting choreography remains as cool and intricate as ever, it's the plot that fails to hold the viewer's attention. The action sequences are still a highlight, but they're overshadowed by the film's nonsensical storyline.

#### Characters

Keanu Reeves reprises his role as John Wick but seems to be going through the motions. The new characters introduced are caricatures rather than fleshed-out individuals. The villains are so over-the-top that they become comedic figures rather than menacing adversaries.

#### Conclusion

""John Wick 4"" ends up being a boring comedy of absurd, losing the raw intensity and simplicity that made the original films a success. While the action remains engaging, the film feels like it's trying too hard to be edgy and complex, losing its identity in the process."
3,"I honestly don't get why this has such a high score on here.

The fight scenes just wouldn't end, it's like the crew were unable to say ""ok, that's long enough"". Keanu can act, give him some damned lines.... The thing I can not forgive is lifting entire scenes and soundtrack for the movie The Warriors, really??? WTF was all that about? Did they run out of ideas? This franchise deserves better treatment than that.

I felt bored through much of the movie, they could have edited a full out fro this movie and I never would have missed it. The Mr. Nobody character was half ass flushed out at best. Didn't care if he lived or died. At least give the guy a name that has not already been used the the fast and the furious movies. Just sad."
10,"The Cinematography, the writing, the combat and the casting, everything was very well made. A perfect movie. Everyone in this cast played their part very very good. Movies like this don't come often and this one will be remembered and mentioned as one of the best action movies of all time. The dedication and hard work that they went threw to make some of those fight scenes need to be appropriated. It was a magnificent movie and I highly recommend it to everyone. With some movies the first part is always the best and the movie get worse as they go on but not with John wick. With John wick it just gets better and better. Masterpiece."
10,"✨✨✨ Where do I even begin, this movie is an absolute masterpiece. Chapter 4 took this series to levels I did not even think were possible, the last 3 entries in the series were absolutely amazing and were near perfection but chapter 4 is the best by a mile. From Director Chad Stahelski comes the 4th installment of the long running franchisee which is not showing any sign of slowing down. It's like drinking old wine which just tastes better with age and such is the case with John wick series so far, the current one better than the last one.

Well this time stakes are all time high with the High table hell bent on finishing John wick off once and for all by any means Necessary. But the thing is this time our Protagonist is not being hunted like his last outing but is hunting his way up the table in his pursuit for freedom and getting closure on his wife.

This installment has doubled down on everything be it headcounts, length of the action sequences to the gorgeous Cinematography. The use of different light settings in different world zones of Osaka, Paris, Berling or Newyork is a sight to behold which just ups the ante in every possible way. The use of BGM when any action sequence kicks off simply ignites the adrenaline rush until it keeps you wanting for more in a breathtaking style."
6,"First of let's just get this out of the way, the action is great in this movie. It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.

Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.

Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all. I truly hope this was studio pressure, and that Stahelski releases a director's cut to remedy this. I can only assume there's dialog and complex choreography that were cut in lieu of the popcorn stuff."
2,"So, apparently Paris have no Police force, but they all speak English, even when they dont have to, so this is likely a Paris in an alternate dimention.

And the main reason John Wick is such a deadly killer, is that his guns only run out of ammo when there are noone around to shoot, and that they are also deadly at 10 meters range.

All other guns appear to have a max kill range of around 10 feet, but if you hold up your lapel, that should stop any bullet that might have a closer source.

I give up.

There is no way to accurately describe how bad this movie is, you just have to see it.

I truly believe the writers have never seen guns before, or cities, or germans. It is a horrid masterpiece, a turkey of stray bullets that stop before they hit an innocent, or the window behind the target.

I gave it two stars, and one is reserved for Reddick, the actor in this movie."
8,"I am a big fan of the series and loved the first three movies, so I watched it during release weekend.

It is longer than the first three movies and is nearly 3 hours long, but you will be fully engaged with the movie and won't feel that it is long.

They took the action sequences to the next level and set the bar for action movies. Probably no other Hollywood movie in recent memory has come up so many original action sequences.

People who watched the earlier movies should definitely go see this one and you will not be disappointed.

They made Wick look a bit more human in this one than the larger than life figure as he was depicted in the earlier movies. After 4 great movies this is a fitting end to the Wick saga."
4,"Sitting through the nearly 3 hours of this opus, I can't say that I didn't get my money's worth. But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.

What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like ""City Of Lost Children"" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.

Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.

Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from ""No Time To Die"" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.

Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.

Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.

This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.

This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists. All Sound And Fury Adds Up To Nothing."
6,"While the first movie has serious characters and strong enough motives - franchise was dropping quality with each next movie. This time it's just ridiculous. Blind assassin. Good blind assassin. Characters from Burton's Batman. Astonishingly stupid dialogs. Undying everybody. Keanu Reeves aka superman. Lack of blood and gore for movie with such violence. Bulletproof hands. Bulletproof jackets.

Universe in first movie was intriguing, it was dark, mysterious, but realistic enough. Bad guys were just bad guys, smart and practical. And now it's just neon comics with grotesque cartoonish enemies.

Dialogs weren't a strong part in any of Wick's franchise movie, but here they're are just terrible. Action is good, but way too long. What will we see in next part? New suit with carbon nipples? Wick will rise from his grave? Fall damage off completely?"
9,"3 scenes were the best action/fight scenes I have ever seen, and boy I have seen a lot!!

3rd place: the stairs fight ... it was done perfectly ... cameras placement and rotation was just amazing ...

2nd place: the Paris roundabout fight ... how did they think about this? I mean, the execution was simply unmatched ..

1st place: the bird-eye view fight in the old building (the best angle of a fight scene I have ever seen), it was like a 2D game from the top .. like the ones we used to play on old consoles but with today's technology, I have to say that this is the best way I have seen to shoot a fight scene!!

A perfect finale ... amazing job!!"
10,"Few times in lives have I experienced the action genre evolve and setting a new standard for how action films should be made. Not much about the world of John Wick makes sense, unless you accept this alternative reality where assassin's roam the streets and run the world from the shadows, but it doesn't matter when you watch this film because you're watching art. This film is easily the best in the series due to it's perfected choreography. At times I would drop my jaw and start wondering how any of these scenes where possible until next scene would come and amaze me yet again. I was a bit disappointed at end of the film, but then again all good thing a come to an end. I refuse to believe John Wick is gone."
1,"I know John wick is about the old revenge cliche ""if you hurt me I'll hurt you twice "" that sentence in John wick 4 is more like ""if you hurt me I'll try and beat a 100 of you before we can get on with the movie "" There is no movie in this disaster of a 4th movie !!

It's just way way too much the ongoing fight scenes ,they will never end and I don't know how many times he went up those stairs to get knocked down again ,it was exhausting to watch .

I loved the triologi and it's a dam shame to finish it off with this failure of a movie .

I love Keanu Reeves,he is a great human being and let's face not that great an actor ,but still he carried John wick to perfection and shoulda been rewarded with a stunning writer ,who shoulda brought this movie home ,the way we all and Keanu deserved ."
9,"First of all, I went to the cinema as soon as it came out and I must say that it should never be watched outside of the cinema. It's an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching. Its really really good action movie.

From a technical perspective, the film is phenomenal, especially the bird's-eye view scene. My mouth was wide open, it was amazing, and I couldn't get enough of the action. Every fight choreography was well thought out, yes, some parts were exaggerated, but it suited the pace very well. The staircase scene is the biggest example of making these long and single-shot action scenes aesthetic, and it's a great achievement.

In terms of acting, I think it was very good. Even though Keanu Reeves played emotionless at times, this role suits him very well. Especially there is one name that fits perfectly, Bill Skarsgård, he played amazingly and I loved it. Also, Killa, played by Scott Adkins, was amazing. It was one of the most entertaining scenes I've watched in a long time, even though the fight with John was a bit weird, it was fantastic. I watched it breathlessly. I won't mention everyone individually, but the performances were more than enough from the stunt doubles to the one-scene actors.

It improves the action of the first 2 films and develops the lack of subject matter or subject matter presentation in the 3rd film, making a very aesthetic mix. They covered the biggest flaw in this series.

Also, another good thing was the harmony of the music to the scenes, every music was perfectly fine, which I think increased the pleasure of the action scenes by a click or two.

There is not much to say, it's a satisfying, exciting, and aesthetic film. Although it lacks emotionally at times, it never stands out and uses its time wonderfully. I loved the movie, and I highly recommend watching it in the cinema instead of waiting to watch it at home."
4,"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary 3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Then there's the blatant plagerism of Walter Hill's, The Warriors which demonstrates just how little new the franchise has to offer. Time to call it a day."
7,"Sorry to say, but this could and should have been a tight 90 minutes long. I'm not sure how it even was 2 hours 49 minutes as not much really happened in the way of story.

Yes, the choreography of the many fights is amazing - the top down sequence in an house is very well done.

As many have pointed out, making John Wick pretty much impervious to pain or damage makes it all rather predictable. The complete disinterest of law enforcement to the proceedings is one thing, but people continuing to dance while baddies take axes to the head around them is just farcical.

So an enjoyable if flawed action movie in need of some heavy editing."
7,"Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a ""John Wick"" movie then you know what's coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack and moody lighting. On this front ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" delivers and then some.

There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.

Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.

At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.

So is it a great film? Well yes because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" plays it straight down the line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a right belter."
8,"The fourth chapter of the John Wick saga sees the titular hero search for a way out of the business.

Let me start by saying this film is among the most ridiculous I've ever seen. But it is par for the course with this series.

Their are new characters and new locations, most of which add something to the mythology. And mythology is the right word, for none of the action makes sense, it is beyond hyper-realism it is in the realm of heroic myth.

John Wick is again the man of few words and a lot of punches, Mr Reeves best type of role it seems, who must battle his way towards a goal. Donnie Yen comes from Hong Kong kung fu cinema to add something a little different, but don't expect his physical behaviour to match that of the blind man he supposedly is (a needless plot point that does very little). Our favourite samurai, Hiroyuki Sanda, plays his part well and the Osaka sequence looks the best of the big fight locations (which is all this movie really is) A new black character, ""Mr Nobody"", played by Shamiel Anderson, adds a little and has a dog that evokes memories of the original films motivation

The new villain de rigour of Hollywood, Bill Skarsgard, plays the baddie whose French accent sounds mostly French. He is the most interesting addition.

This film is fights, fights, fights and then some fights. It is so overblown it becomes partially transcendent. On some level this is satisfying and I can't help but give it a good rating. When filmmakers focus on what fans want they get the rewards. This film doesn't make sense, I could talk for 3000 words on all the absurdities of this film, but in some very strange way it actually does make sense."
8,"It is not only outstanding but rather mind-blowing in terms of camerawork, so much so that at times your jaw drops to the ground. The lighting of the scenes are also state-of-the-art, making pictures as real as dreamlike, monumental, just like when you enter a cathedral, look up up and say: wow! I do not know how much CGI was involved in that case, but: wow!

As for the story, it is far from the first picture, yet much more convincing then the 2nd and 3d instalment of the franchise. It is, mind you, extremely violent, full of killing, so be prepared. The camerawork, the lighting and the editing achieve its goal of looking like a graphic novel. The music in that terms is far behind but, thanks for God, at least it's not irritating.

I'd say this one may not match the first episode (story like) but way-way better as a picture.

A fantastic visual achievement."
8,"With every new passing John Wick movie we generally now have an idea what to expect, this movie continues a very similar format like previous but cinematography is spot on, action sequences heightened, set pieces are more vivid and a plot that sees Mr Wick running out of time.

Plot was good, a continuation with the stakes heightened and the higher table hell bent on bringing John down with added help at play.

Pace of this movie is really good, never lagging and action well balanced with old and new cast playing their part.

These movies work because they push the boundaries by upping the anti with glorious visuals with this being inspired by Samurai movies it has a real artistic feel and brilliant in IMAX!"
9,"The movie is very good. It contains all the elements of a action movie. It tells about the basic principles of friendship and human nature of self respect. The main character of John wick played by Keanu Reeves is portrayed as good as possible. Donnie yen also gave his full potential for his role. The movie is good but some action scenes in starting are too long , action scenes are top level, the movie can be watched by anyone it is not at all r rated that much .The visuals are marvellous , and the dialogue are nicely delivered, The movie is good to watch . Must watch in theatres . Best movie of 2023."
4,"I wanted to like this movie so badly. The first three were great, albeit gradually declining in quality throughout the series. I was excited and hopeful for the fourth installment but couldn't have been let down more. The action was boring by mid film and there was still another hour and a half to go at that point. This movie is ten minutes shy of three hours long. The fight scenes go on way longer than they need to, moves are repeated over and over and the plot armor of JW becomes laughable. If you like the film because John is a regular guy with crazy skills, you'll hate this. If you see him as some kind of superhero then you'll probably enjoy it. The guy legit falls out of 5 story buildings onto stone roadways and just rolls over and gets up. It felt insulting to my intelligence."
7,"I'm very confused by the ratings for this movie. It was super fun and had some really cool world building but John Wick getting hit by 100 cars and bouncing up, using his jacket like it's Vibranium, and effortless shooting through the full armor of villains was fun but absurd. The gun trick at the end was really obvious, like how would that person not realize John didn't fire? The sound editing and the angle of the camera make it very easy to see all this. I do not get why this is getting rated higher than other Wick movies. One was small budget and really clever and tight, and 2 was bigger and more action but still realistic. 3 gets a little more absurd but by the stair scene in the 4th movie it's like a DC movie because it's too dark for marvel."
2,"How John Wick started off and what has become of it now, is a sheer disappointment. This last episode is nothing but complete utter continuous boring firing sequences that make no sense at all. I kept forwarding hoping to find some story , some twists or something to give me a reason why many had given it a rating of more than 7. This last movie has badly failed by all standards. I wonder how so much money is spent on these type of movies yet no one has any brain to raise any flags. Seems, everyone involved in making these type of movies is only bothered to make their buck and go home. For sure, this was the last one for me. Done and dusted for John Wick...."
8,"9/10 Storytelling 8/10 Action 8/10 Overall

Excellent storytelling throughout by outstanding actors. Every scene is deliberately drawn out with thoughtful dialogue to reveal the nature of each character and their intentions with John Wick.

The action scenes are a combination of all of the previous installments with enemies new and old alike. A little variance in the killing is also present with a mixture of guns, melee weapons and environments.

Between all of the killing are the small moments that characters share with each other in dialogue, expressions and even just the musical track in the background. This really builds the character personalities for the small amount of screen time that some of them get making them truly memorable.

Not really necessary to see on the big screen unless you're really into killing sprees."
5,"Loved John Wick 1-3 but even though this one has some highlights it's too much praising weaponry. 3 hours of associating weapons with masculinity and power and the only way to solve problems feels like a movie from the 70ties and not 2023. When Winston gave John Wick the Viper gun it feels like they were looking at a pinup girl the only thing missing was the sliver coming out of his mouth. And of course everyone has a weapon, whole Paris is armed, this is the model. And wait, it's all guys fighting and shooting. Not a single female (except one but the producer decided her main weapon is a sword). The attribute of 'power' is associated with 'men'.

What have we learned from the mass shootings? These dump shooting scenes are just inspiring some loners craving for fame, success and visibility, eventually grabbing daddies firearm to finally feel strong, powerful and manly, aiming for the catastrophe, because they don't know better because nobody educated them better. The endless mass shooting scenes in this movie leave us with a bitter taste in our mouth because the winner is always the hero, the mass shooter. Stop associating weapons with manhood and power and the mains to solve problems. Just stop it. The Wild West had ended. It's 2023. We can do smarter movies and more inspiring movies and teach our children how to solve problems without violence such as civil disobedience or being involved in politics and education."
8,"The total review of the film would be interesting.

The start was good, the flow of movie was fast enough and the ending was unexpected and beautiful. Both happy and sad about the finish, sad that we wouldn't have another John wick and happy that they didn't extend it anymore, it would be spoiled.

I have a criticism about the scenes in the square which many cars drove by and a lot of fighting was happening. Those scenes seemed very artificial and I couldn't connect with them, I supposed they could be executed much better and in more natural fashion like we've seen in previous John wicks.

All in all, thank you. John wick franchise is one of my favorites and I always love it."
3,"The fight scenes tell it all . . . Excruciatingly slow and overly choreographed. The guys he fights move forward and back like rag dolls without any effort on Keanu's part with overly emphasized movements. At one point the guy he was fighting had a gun and just held it limply waiting his turn to get his ass kicked. I saw the nods to the Matrix in a few scenes (the rain scene and the subway scene) which was interesting but I'm telling you the fight scenes were yawnworthy. The storyline was weak too . . . I thought he was going to take on the twelve but not only did he not do that but we are left with almost no knowledge about the 12. I would have liked to do more of a deep dive on that subject . . . Surely we could have investigated that more deeply in the THREE HOURS?? Keanu's movements are also getting too slow and deliberate. In a way I think that's why they ended his story . . . He probably wanted out. It was great to see Laurence Fishburne again since they snubbed him in the last Matrix movie but I would have liked to see more of a deep dive with his character. Overall I give this Mr Wick's swansong a ""C"""
2,"I thought the previous John Wick movies were just a bit over the top with all the fighting but this latest one takes the cake. I watched the first hour, praying silently: Please let the fighting stop for a moment and give me a bit of a story instead! To no avail! If you love lots of martial art and mass killings of bad as well as good guys every minute of this movie then you will love it. In my eyes it is a parody of all the action movies ever made. A blind former friend doing incredible damage by sound alone. Really? John Wick miraculously escaping all the firing of automatic weapons pointed at him? From five feet away? The only realistic scenes in the whole movie are the ones where our hero actually has to reload his gun periodically. First time I've seen that in an action movie. So make it two stars instead of one! Just kidding! Summing up, if you like to see unbroken action containing martial arts, combined with automatic weapons you will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for good action movies, watch the ""Die Hard"" series again!"
6,"This by itself is a pretty decent movie not as good as Chapter 2 but about as good as the other 2. However, the impression that I get from the first 3 John Wick movies is that he doesn't die and is incredibly skilled. In this though he dies after getting shot 3 times which he survives similar things in the other movies. Because of this it just feels like it was rushed and just missed the point of the rest of the franchise. The CGI was unimpressive but the last time I watched a new film it was Avatar: The Way Of Water so it might just be my expectations being set too high. On the bright side the extras were much better than in the previous films."
6,"I had some fun watching the film but I was disappointed quite often as well. I'll start positive. Keanu is kind of cool so that helped a lot. Now to some criticism. As others have mentioned, most of the fight scenes were choreographed so embarrassingly bad that I spent most of the film watching bad guys standing off to the side and waiting for their turn for John Wick to kill them. We see literally hundreds of trained assassins pointing and shooting high powered automatic weapons John at (who is usually standing out in the open) and yet non ever strike John. John falls flat on his face from the top of a building, gets hit 5 times by speeding cars,rolls down 6 flights of stairs after being pummeled relentlessly and in every case gets up almost none worse for wear. Even his suit never got dirty. At some points I accidentally laughed out loud.

A huge, huge plot hole was the radio announcer stating John's every move and update (including the increasing bounty money for killing John Wick). There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time. Who listens to radio now anyway?

The ending!?! Did he die? Did I miss it? One minute he's shot but still walking, talking needing a little rest and bath. The next scene shows his tombstone. Totally disappointing vague ending.

I had no idea how long the film was. It actually went fairly quickly although most of the fight scenes were double the length I felt they needed to be."
5,"Shame that once again the US industry could not think further than faking foreign accent instead of having a French comedian in the cast. Why make the character foreign at all if he can't even speak the language or even copy the accent? And he does speak a lot!

Other than that, typical John Wick movie with all the fighting and killing one would expect without any real surprises. Same goes with most action movies franchises these days. Entertaining enough. And there's Keanu. Great actor and great man. Recommended for all fans of fighting scenes, fighting choreography and same characters coming straight out of comic books."
1,"I was really excited about this movie since it had such good reviews in here. Now I know that I won't be trusting any IMDB reviews ever again - So far the worst movie I've ever seen.

I can't believe they managed to stretch 20 minutes script into 3 hours. Plot didn't move forward at all. Fighting scenes were EXTREMELY long and unrealistic. Acting was poor and hard to watch. Dialogues that were apparently meant to be « funny » were the corniest I've ever heard.

To be honest I would watch Shark Tornado or Twilight rather that this.

Do yourself a favor and use your spear 3 hours to something else. This wasn't worth of the money or the time."
9,"This is the best John Wick movie in my opinion. The action is amazing just as always, and I especially love the Japanese influence that the first hour has. Donnie Yen's character Caine is probably the best character the franchise has introduced besides Wick himself. This movie does a great job of expanding on John's more emotional arc. John realizing that the freedom he wants isn't going to be fulfilling and that he has the opportunity to give the life he wanted to Caine is great storytelling, and is elevated by Keanu Reeves' layered performance. John's sacrifice is great and I think they did a perfect job sending the character off. On top of the amazing writing and action, the directing is amazing and the cinematography is the best in the franchise. 9/10."
9,"John Wick could be one of the best franchises ever. I doubt there will be a 5th John Wick movie because you'll see. It's kind of too long but (it's 2hr and 50 min) but I enjoyed every moment. My favorite scene Is the fighting scene which was filmed in Paris. The movie opened $72M in it's domestic box office which was expected. R. I. P Lance Riddick. I was so sad when I watched him in the movie. I think this is Keanu Reeves best movie even better than The Matrix. It's currently certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes with a score of 92%. I think it will be the best action movie of 2023.

It's worth watching it in theaters. I loved the movie."
3,"Wearing. Killing. Killing. Killing. Mostly by judo tossing the opponent to the ground and shooting them in the head at close range. Over and over and over to the point of absurdity. Wick falls two stories onto concrete, gets up and brushes himself off like Jake Blues. Dog gets hit head on by a car at 80 mph, flies 25 yards, gets up and just growls. Just absolutely ridiculous. Anti-cerebral trash for the simple minded. If you watch the first 15 minutes, you've seen all you need to see. Best part was driving home with my adult son and laughing at how stupid everything was. Was glad when it ended. We were both concerned at the good reviews it's receiving. Concerned for our society."
1,"I've never been more disappointed in a film and it's all due to the pathetic and unsatisfying ending. I'm through with sagas.

The beginning was great as was most of the action sequences. Although there were unnecessary characters that have absolutely no real effect on the movie other than to add time to the movie.

The comic relief from a dog was the best part of the last 15 minutes.

The Easter egg at the end was unnecessary and realky served no purpose.

I'll never watch anything by these writers or the director even if it's a commercial.

This is a movie to rent instead of paying for it as you will only watch it once or at least that is all I'm ever going to watch it.

I want my time and money back. I wish I could grow extra thumbs to give it more than 2 thumbs down. Hollywood is over."
6,"Like many John Wick fans I considered the original film to be an amazing sleeper hit with an original premise that reignited Keanu Reeves' star power, and John Wick: Chapter 2 was a bombastic sequel that took us deeper into the world of Wick's former livelihood.

John Wick: Chapter 3 made me grow numb and impatient sitting in my chair. It was like watching someone play a Beat Em' Up (or Shoot Em' Up) game where they go through waves of enemies until they get to the level boss. Streets of Rage and Time Crisis come to mind. Anyone who is a gamer and a film buff knows what I'm talking about. In John Wick: Chapter 4 it felt like more of the same.

A recurring theme since the third film is that John Wick is given literal plot armor in the form of a Kevlar suit, but also the waves of bullet sponge henchmen he can effectively dispatch with a headshot. JUST. LIKE. A. VIDEOGAME. He can also survive getting thrown off a roof AND fall down five flights of steps. Might as well give Wick a life bar floating over his head.

Then there are the dogs with a pencant for biting men's testes and the stock cartoon European Villain of the Week who uses underhanded methods to kill Wick. Russian, Italian, German, French, whatever. They're all interchangeable.

Ditto for the largely Asian ""top assassins"" that will pop up to give Keanu Reeves the best choreographed fight scene. And let's not forget the EDM clubs and metro city subways where civilians are largely oblivious to what's going on.

All of this stuff is trite and cliche, and I guess this is what people like because it's a break from the superhero fare that has saturated the action movie genre for the past 15 to 25 years.

Maybe it's because I grew up in a decade (1990's) where there were still good high-profile films being produced in a sea of higher-profile schlock that my film tastes are hungry for something engaging and thought-provoking, and John Wick 4 ain't it no matter how much people try to pretend that the world these characters live in is compelling."
6,"Henchmen just standing there, waiting to get hit, reacting to things that didn't hit them, people in the club just doing the same dance even while people are being killed right in front of them, the cars in traffic keeps moving even while people are getting killed, cars are crashing and bullets are flying, but nope.. traffic just keeps on going. I can't unsee any of it.

It looks painfully unnatural compared to how well the previous 3 films handled the fighting.

There's a ton of wasted movement and shot decisions based on making a scene look ""pretty"" rather than ""good.""

I know they can do better. I've seen it.

A couple cute twists of the story doesn't really carry the rest of the film, but it was at least still entertaining."
2,"Absolutely ridiculous. Enjoyed the original film but the writers have completely lost their grip on reality on this one. Good stunts and the acting ok but come on.... OK, I was going to write a quick review but as you cannot on this platform here we go ... a blind man as an assassin? Really? Blind man hits extremely accurate shots throughout film that 20 20 eyesighted characters could not achieve on every occasion throughout the film. Really liked the stunts but the distinct lack of realism ruined the whole film. Complete nonsense from start to finish. I hope Keanu got paid enough to sell himself short. Please don't pay to see this."
10,"So full of ideas I am sure I need to watch it a lot more. Yeah it was great on the big screen. Like being there. Like you are a drone looking in on the action. Yeah some lemon haze half way in was a good choice for me. Better than a video game! Hard to believe I did not know so many of the spoilers since I followed the online info pretty closely. Over the last few pandemic years. Keanu is the quintessential action movie star. John Wick IS the wrathful deity. I have heard it will be available for streaming in May. I'll be running it all day.

Not for kids. Do NOT let your ex husband take little kids cuz he wants to see it. The good news is that it has intergenerational appeal as long as you are over 14 ."
3,"A film that abounds in good scenography, good photography and good music, but the premise of the film itself is a total unknown... the whole film is in a dark tone with the already known premise of a good guy against a bad guy with a million victims, and who is hit by just a few bullets out of a billion fired at him. ... All in all, there is no plot itself for 90 minutes, let alone the 170 that they managed to stretch the film with endless scenes of fights and ""dodging"" bullets.

After movies like this, everyone is surprised when the kids rush into the school with an automatic rifle, imagining that they are John Wick, ie alone against everyone in their numb drugged brains.

I was expecting some kind of let's say grandiose film like the previous Chad Stahelski films about John Wick, but we got nothing from the former stuntman except a bunch of stunt scenes .... this film is just proof that some people should not be in the business of directing because they start to exaggerate.

All in all, an average stunt movie that is worth watching only when you are very, very, very bored in life, and otherwise if you need to bathe the dog or clean strawberries from seeds, it is better to deal with that than to waste 3 hours of your life on this ""film""."
5,"... or should we call it John Anderson 4? Almost 3 hours without any story behind it, persons are just persons, no personality, no story telling about them, just brainless running, shooting, fighting, falling and repeat. Yeah, effects are amazing, Keanu is in the perfect shape and performing at his best, but there is nothing else in this movie. I really looking forward to seeing this movie, I did not watch any trailer, did not read any article to be max. Surprised and I was. Sadly, very sadly, not in the positive way. I hope that spin-off Ballerina will be something more interesting and it won't go way of the ""John Wick"" saga."
2,"There really is very little story time - maybe 20 minutes of the runtime - but probably not that much. The rest is just basically the same kind of fight scene, repeated over and over in different locations. The locations are mostly great - the monotonous action wears very thin quite early on.

I seem to remember that some of the earlier Wick movies had proper story lines - somewhere along the line they ditched them for non-stop repetitive action - action that stretches credulity well past breaking point - but some of it, especially towards the end, was ridiculous nonsense.

For any serious movie buff this installment completely fails to make the grade and is a total waste of time. Worse, it sullies the franchise.

2 stars for the locations, and because it's professionally made technically.

Minus 8 points for the lack of an engaging story and for reaching a new high for banal gratuitous violence.

Summary: So bad it's almost funny. But it's not funny, it's vacuous nonsense that cost a fortune to produce."
5,"The only two parts I loved about the movie was at Berlin with the fat German guy and at New York's library. The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all... To conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable 😂)."
5,"Come on buys and girls: a solid 8 on imdb for his piece of crap? What an unbelievable dumb movie with a stupid story line although the previous 3 movies have the same problem. But the action and killing in this movie is over the top and a certain point boring because of the amount of attackers and John survives evrything. Unfortunately because after an hour I was only thinking: my God, kill the guy and get over with this movie. There is no humor in the movie, the ""story-line"" makes no sense at all and all the action is way over the top. It is not entertaining but only annoying and I really hope the guy is dead, will stay dead and no John Wick part 5. What a waste of more than 2,5 hours...."
1,"So you know where I'm coming from, the John Wick series is a kinda guilty pleasure for me. The first one impressed me with the Red Circle club's joyful murder-set-to-dance music scene, and I loved the mythic, supernatural world of assassins in the Continental Hotel. In John Wick 2 and John Wick 3, that mythical assassin world got expanded, and I loved it. There were inventive fight scenes that were fun to watch, and these increased with each installment. The dialogue was cryptic but interesting to listen to, and even Wick's briefest opponents during fights had distinctive features to them that made them memorable.

But John Wick 4 is a giant dropoff in quality. The characters are dull (Donnie Yen is a charisma black hole, as well as an african american actor called ""The Tracker"" who cannot act for his life, and is apprently there as a condescending ""he has a dog like John Wick, so you must like him"" ploy) and even Keanu's laconic delivery is lifeless. Natalia Tena is the one bright spot, playing Katia, a Romani leader who brings John back into the fold. The dialogue doesn't have the mystique of 2 or 3, and one wonders about the absence of writers that contributed to 2 and 3. The fight scenes tend to be long and boring, with a horrid final fight scene involving endless stairs and samey opponents, that Wick ends up rolling down to to the bottom of, so he has to do it all over again against more faceless opponents. Briight spots in the action involve a fun ""Frogger"" style action scene in traffic around the Arc Du Triomphe in Paris, and an overhead view of John Wick setting opponents on fire with special incendiary rounds. The previous scene unfortunately re-uses the dance music from the Red Circle action sequence from the first film, so it seems they did not trust the audience to appreciate it without a musical callback to a better scene in a better movie. Speaking of music, the iconic Wick music is almost utterly absent other than the Red Circle Club music aforementioned, and there is no new music that is any way memorable.

The cinematography is monochrome and depressing. It might as well be black and white for the color variation expressed. Gone is the colorful neon look of the first 3, replaced by orange and blue, sunrise and sunset, gold colored interiors, fire lit, or candle-lit interiors. It's visually boring.

As far as plot goes, if you were hanging on the edge of your seat wondering how Winston's betrayal of John in the last movie was going to resolve itself, well, they solve this issue by having a new baddie show up and shoot a fan favorite, Lance Reddick's Charon character, to make us forget Winston's betrayal, because now Wick can focus on killing the new Baddie instead of Winston. Also, if you were impressed by the mysterious Arab lord over the high table, to whom John sacrificed a finger in 3, John knocks him off easily within the first five minutes. Speaking of which, Donnie Yen's character is blind, and it's suggested he sacrificed his eyes the way John did his finger, but with none of the impact of seeing it happen on screen as it did with John in 3.

I don't know why this movie decided to be a cash grab instead of another movie of love and care as it seemed the first 3 were, but it is. It's really odd that this movie is suddenly being praised all over the place, when the first 3 all had mixed reviews. And this one is the worst of the 4 by far."
9,"I went, I saw, I was indeed captivated. I must add I had the privilege of working with Ian McShane and he is indeed a gentleman and pretty much what we see on the screen. Truly the addition of other characters and old friends created brush strokes of a master. Skarsgård was perfect. 'An arrogant ass!' I always sit in awe the production value and working in the industry always sit to the very end of the credits because without their talent brought to the screen, we'll again that's why they are called 'credits'. Take my advice, sit and watch to the end. It's deserved! Were there unbelievable moments? Of course! That's John Wick! His a 47 regular and and all I can say he looks damn good in that suit.

""John! What have you done!!!!"" And don't mess with anyone's dog, that's my kind of hero!"
1,"I've seen the first John Wick, and it delivered on many levels. I haven't seen the other Wick films, however, I caught this one recently.

I don't understand how ""action"" can be a substitute for everything else. There is no plot in this movie -- the dialogue could have been made up on the spot and it won't matter.

Also, bullets don't kill people -- all clothing is bulletproof, and 2 headshots minimum to ensure the baddie is dead.

As per the fight scenes... they're long. I am not sure if they're good... but they definitely are long. Some are so long, you'd forget why they're fighting (which isn't a problem to be honest)."
6,"Late in the fourth film bearing his name, indestructible hitman John Wick (Keanu Reeves) falls down some stairs. Quite a few stairs, actually - tossed by an enemy down the 222 steps of Paris's famed Rue Foyatier on his way to the final showdown at the Sacré-Coeur Basilica, he tumbles down one flight after another like a Slinky in an immaculately tailored suit. He finally crumples on to a landing, only to get hurled once more down the rest of the stairs, at which point the absurd amount of time spent watching him roll back over the path he just climbed turns into its own deadpan, sisyphean joke."
9,"""No one, not even you, can kill everyone.""

John Wick: Chapter 4 is directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves, Ian Mcshane, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Skarsgard, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen.

Was a little late to the party in regards to the John Wick franchise. I didn't discover it until 2019 before Chapter 3 and then I binged the previous movies before I saw that and instantly fell in love with it. On it's surface the premise of these movies could've easily turned out to be another generic action movie but what elevates these movies in my opinion is Chad Stahelski who with these movies has proved that he's one of the best action directors working in the business today. I'm definitely looking forward to whatever he does next as a director. The action here was phenomenal.

Honestly, this series really evolved like a video game. The first movie was, generally speaking, more grounded because the game was just beginning and John was low level. But then he survived and levelled up, so the second movie introduced upgraded armour and weapons and so on. That's why Wick was able to survive such ridiculous stuff in 3 and 4: he was a really high level vitality build.

The cast was great here obviously Keanu Reeves is always a delight but Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen did a good job here. It was also really cool to see Scott Adkins in a big movie like this I'm glad he got some much deserved attention in the spotlight even if he was hidden behind a fat suit. Without spoiling anything I will say that the end of this movie definitely surprised me as I didn't expect it to go where it did. After walking out I was conflicted on the ending but the more I thought about it the more It grew on me. I am intrigued to see where the franchise does go from here though. I assume Len Wiseman's Ballerina spin-off movie with Ana De Armas starring is next up and I would be lying if I said I wasn't slightly excited to see that."
9,"Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters lacked the background they needed.

Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy, especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too unbelievable and ridiculous. Instead of introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy - that was just a huge let-down.

And as much as I love all the action scenes - and they were the best and longest thus far, they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. In the three-hour runtime, there's maybe a 15-20 min story, the rest is overboard non-stop action that is mostly ridiculous - yes, still the best I've ever seen, and it will probably be a long time before that's topped, if ever, but so much of it with so little story, unbalanced the overall viewing experience. The current narrative barely constituted a two-hour film, let alone three hours. Nevertheless, still an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better and more in abundance."
4,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is almost three hours of Keanu Reeves engaged in a gunfight, bookended with meaningless dialog-in-place-of-plot, and a lot of people being thrown down stairs. Of all the ""Wick"" movies, this is clearly the weakest one yet. Was anything added to the overall Wick-universe narrative? No. Did we see a whole lot of inconsequential people die? Yes. Did Keanu Reeves say ""yeah"" a lot? Yes.

Look, I was hoping for SO much more than this. A meaningful ending to the series (which it isn't, because apparently this made so much money they are working on a fifth film), but what we got here was something in very much need of more script doctoring and less ""bang-bang.""

With a little more work, this could have been an average movie. Don't talk to me about stunts or cinematography or the choreography of the actors in-play, wow me with a plot that makes sense and moves the story forward--John Wick 4 does not move the story forward. It just says ""let's shoot a bunch of people, okay?"" And that's what it does... for 3 hours.

In the end I was of the following opinion once the credits rolled: ...and?...

We all deserved better than this. John Wick did, too."
5,"Some really good action scenes can't overcome the hurdles of overconcoluted lore and a story which a 5 year old would write.

The fist movie worked in its simplicity with impactful action, you could nearly feel the punches watching it. By the fourth movie its just an unwanted parody of itself.

Where you can't help yourself but laugh at the ridiculous scenes, which seem to be in there for the rule of cool - for me it didn't work. The stakes are just gone if seemingly fall damage is disabled for the main character for the hundredth time or you can see the random mob encounters in the background just waiting until its there time to get shot."
6,"Not sure where people are getting ""the best Wick/action movie ever"", because that's not the movie I watched. I just watched the first 3 Wick movies before this one, and I'm glad I did. Because the quality between them is glaringly obvious. Any action flick like these you have to suspend your imagination, but between JW1 and JW4, well you might as well remove your brain before stepping in to the theater. I appreciated JW1 because he got hurt and you could see the suffering as the film went on. The shooting and fight scenes were tactical and tight and extremely well coordinated. JW2, little more suspension with the bullet proof suit, ""but it's gonna hurt"". And it did. He got hit by a couple cars, eh ok it's a movie. He got stitched up here and there, etc. But by the time we get to JW4, bullets are now bouncing off the bullet proof suit that everyone is wearing, not using cover and just covering their head with the coat, getting hit by cars at full speed over and over and over and then dropping from 2 stories, crushing the roof of a van and just chugging along. And John Wicks aim has gotten a lot worse. It's too bad. The series started to degrade just a bit with JW3 and this one just went full send."
10,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an action masterpiece, an emotionally investing, unashamedly pretentious and extremely satisfying final chapter that continues to celebrate stunt work as the art form it absolutely is and deliver franchise high spectacle that really does put the majority of other action films to shame.

Keanu Reeves is even more agile than ever and continues to really impress in the action despite being 4 films in. Once again though, it's not just the action he excels at with the sense of finality this time around adding a sombre and contemplative nature to his performance that is beautiful.

The supporting cast is insanely stacked, a definite new record for this franchise. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne play to their familiar strengths and really dial them up. Then there's the newcomers, starting with Shamier Anderson who has a really interesting angle to his character that's a lot of fun.

Rina Sawayama makes a terrific screen debut and has great chemistry with Hiroyuki Sanada who can do no wrong and his reunion with Reeves is a joy to see. Bill Skarsgård is another memorable villain for this franchise as a character who dresses like a gentleman but acts like the complete opposite.

Scott Adkins plays against type in hilarious fashion and then there's Donnie Yen. Obviously he's perfect in the action scenes and just so cool but on top that he's one of the best characters because his conflict with John isn't as black and white as previous antagonists, making it all the more interesting.

Chad Stahelski's direction is phenomenal, the action scenes are still super clean and impeccably choreographed. There's a nightclub scene that actually improves over the original, a fight in oncoming traffic that's jaw droppingly good and a one take that is one of the best of all time.

The film also offers an excellent reminder that Stahelski is an amazing visual stylist as well. With Dan Laustsen's cinematography he creates a beautifully film that makes each location visually unique and the lighting in particular is just stunning throughout.

The pacing is so good, gaining momentum early on and never letting up. The music by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard is once again incredible, bringing back all the greatest hits without solely relying on them and actually creating the most unique score of the four with plenty of new pieces."
2,"I liked the other John Wick's. This one was over the top ridiculous. From the blind man that was somehow a better swordsman than everyone and a better shot than everyone to the fat guy that somehow could fight like chuck norris... The movie is about 2:45 with at least 2:15 of that time gun fights at close range where everyone gets hit but no one seems to die.

Yes, I realize it's a movie but the unrealistic activities are way too much.. seems more like a version of the animated Batman show from the 70's where the bad guys just keep coming out.... Over and over again...

Super explosive fight scenes but no plot whatsoever... very disappointed. I paid $20 for this crap."
4,"I have to see the first one again after a lapse of many, many years.

For those who haven't seen other similar modern ones, these two: Death Sentence(2007) and I Am Wrath(2016) also worth your time.

This movie sets out to be the final installment in the franchise that sees the events following the first three films of the series. The movie is about an old retired assassin who has fallen from grace with everyone out to get him. This latest entry hopes to put an end to his years of conflict with the High Table a secret organization that has put an ever-growing bounty on his head.

As with previous John Wick films, there is a main antagonist that Wick must get rid off. There are lot of side characters in this one, that draws away the attention from Wick. Indeed Wick is not the focus of attention of this film. Bill Istvan Günther Skarsgård who plays Marquis Vincent de Gramont, the antagonist, a suave and aristocratic sadist and head of the High Table, along with Donnie Yen who plays Caine(biblical reference) a blind assassin of the High table. These two steal the show along with short cameos from my favorite actor Laurence Fishburne(Just Cause 1995 and Hannibal 2013-2015 TV Series).

Verdict: the action sequences are standard with today's action-thriller genre. Nothing outstanding to speak off. The reason being over-saturation of movies in the internet and the film industry as a whole worldwide.

There will come a time people will stop watching movies altogether. The same is true with the PC/Console gaming industry. As soon as you figure out both are ""scripted"" you'll see the ""light"". All I recommend as wholesome entertainment for the family are 70's-80's comedy shows like The Jeffersons, Good Times, Sanford and Son, The Cosby Show, Silver Spoons, Different Strokes, Webster and many more...

Stay safe and thank you for taking the time to read this review."
1,"This movie has achieved something that no other movie has ever achieved: This is a long movie with a running time of almost 3 hours (2 hours and 49 minutes), but the entire 169 minutes are simply an endless repetition of the same 10-second clip -- i.e., Keanu Reeves shoot a guy twice on the chest, grapple him, shoot one more time on the head, and refresh and repeat with another guy.

Other than this, there is absolutely nothing in the movie. No decent story. No decent acting. No reasonable character development. Nothing. There is not even a single memorable action scene in the movie as all the scenes are something they have already used in the previous movies in the series. Each action sequence lasts good 10-15 minutes, and it was excruciating to watch them because it was so boring to watch the same action scene over and over.

If you take a 10 minutes action sequence from the original John Wick and repeat it for 17 times, you will get John Wick 4. This is truly atrocious. Our time is worth much more than this."
3,"The filmmakers could have benefited from exercising patience and taking the time to craft a more cohesive and compelling narrative. By rushing to capitalize on the franchise's popularity, they missed an opportunity to deliver a satisfying conclusion that could have been better received by fans.

It seemed as though the filmmakers didn't put much thought or effort into choreographing compelling action sequences. The fights felt uninspired, and the stunts appeared amateurish. As a viewer, I craved excitement and intensity, but all I got was a series of underwhelming and forgettable action scenes. It's a shame when a film fails to deliver on one of its core aspects, and in this case, the actions truly sucked, leaving me feeling unsatisfied and disengaged throughout the entire movie."
10,"This movie stands upto its genre more than any movie ever has. We see minimum dialogue and more action that not only looks organic, and sometimes even hilarious, but also very memorable, engrossing, and satisfying until the nth minute.

All the actors did a great job performing the stunts. The same cannot be said about the sometimes goofy acting and the D&D universe-like dialogues. They knew what they were doing.

Definitely missed some key characters. And some changes were obviously made due to real life death of the Concierge.

Overall, I loved it, and couldn't look one second away from the screen. Wish the final scene was better written though; but still this one leaves options more open for the future of John Wick's character, while also giving a fitting end if in case sequels wouldn't be made.

Sequel to that or not, there are thankfully atleast some other stories being set up in the franchise as revealed by the post credits and others by news. So we're definitely not done, & we'll be seeing more soon."
5,"I watched a 3h headshot fest where john wick chooses to let himself die on the street after getting shot by a blind man .

Several things bothered me. Mostly the script being appalling / cringe / bland.

I'm French, yet the shootouts in Paris involve American muscle cars, random bad guys and lots of automatic guns. I would have liked to see something a bit more local / that'd ring more true.

Why does JW need to fall from a 3-4 storey building, get hit / run over by 5 cars, and literally fall hundreds of stairs? It's Deadpool level of trauma, but he's meant to only be human. If he can withstand that, why does he die at the end from flesh wounds?

Why pick Scott Adkins to actually act? I'm sure he's buddies with Chad (the director), but the guy can't act, and barely had fight scenes. It also made no sense his character would be such a good fighter.

Why do we get such a lame, young villain? There are much, much better villains out there.

Why have some of the action in Japan?

I guess they wanted to film in Paris, so they made the villain French (I think?). Except he's Swedish, and just doesn't feel French at all

Didn't we deserve anything fresh? We got a recycling of: Kevlar suits, black full body armors (but this time around they're not nearly as bulletproof?), swords, attack dogs, American muscle car scene, motorbike scene. I mean come on.

And why is the man killing John blind? Did he need to be blind?

Visually, it all looked very good. Nothing we haven't seen before, but very visually pretty, the lighting especially. The killing go so repetitive that they switched to full on video game mode with camera from above. It was kind of cool, but also very silly as it felt again like playing a video game on rookie mode.

All in all, an extremely long movie despite zero character / story development, suffering from remarkably bad writing & casting. In a way I'm glad John died because I know i'd keep watching the sequels, like the F&F movies, and feeling dirty afterwards."
8,"John Wick Chapter 4 carries on the story from where it left off in chapter 3, John is still on the run but now he needs to try get the High Table off his back. How he does that or attempts to anyway forms the crux of Chapter 4's storyline.

The solid story combined with outstanding acting from Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Hiroyuki Sanada, Bill Skarsgård, Ian McShane and Lance Riddick leaves you with a gripping story that will have you absorbed in it throughout it's 169 minute runtime.

Combined with excellent action sequences, gunplay, crazy shootouts and fight scenes John Wick Ch 4 is a top notch action film that stands with it's head held high from the mess that Hollywood is nowadays. Especially love the scene where John is clearing the building room by room and the camera is viewing it top down like one of those mobile shooter games.

I loved the movie, It's fun and enjoyable and it definitely deserves the 8 stars I've rated it. The place where the movie looses 2 stars is because John dies at the end and I can't bear to see him not have a happy ending after 4 movies of revenge and death and hatred and anger. So 8/10 from me because of that."
5,"In my opinion, John Wick 4 is just the continuation to John Wick 3. It doesn't bring anything new to the table. Yes, it has good action sequences, but no better than the action sequences of the previous 3 movies.

As for the story, it makes no sense. The characters don't make sense. Not to mention making John Wick practically bulletproof.

I expected something better, something different, not the same from the 3rd part. I was expecting a big end.

That's not the way to end one of the greatest action characters ever created. Well, the truth is that this movie does not show the end of the story, only the end of the main character."
4,"Well, yes, Keanu might be the nicest guy in Hollywood, but this movie is just a shallow, sometimes darkly humoresque, cartoonish, modern fable that fits well with equally shallow times... It is entertaining, though. In this age of boring democratic and relatively peaceful life people are thirsty for violence, revenge and gore, so our natural and primitive animal instincts can get satisfied. This chapter is probably the weakest, by the way. It feels extremely repetitive. I had to rewatch the trailer to make sure I was not going to pay for the same movie I had already watched. Hopefully it will be the last of the franchise, unless they find a way to come up with a radical new idea that can save it."
9,"I just enjoyed John Wick 4 and have to say that the mix of art and action in this movie is just amazing! The fight is presented like a ballet, with smooth movements and highly skilled coordination. This film is absolutely spectacular, and I fell in love with every action that was put into it. The story is simple, but managed to captivate my attention, even though the Marquis character is a bit underdeveloped. But who can deny the greatness of Keanu Reeves as John Wick? She really is stunning! Even though the story is not very strong, the action shown still manages to make up for these weaknesses. However, I feel disappointed with some of the characters who are not so alive, especially vallian, but are still disguised again with the irony that John Wick has to pay for his actions. Overall though, John Wick 4 is a must-see, especially for fans of quirky and skillful action."
7,"The story had some nice setups and payoffs, I enjoyed the story and the ending.

However I didn't like the action. On multiple occasions it was a parody of itself, instead of being cool it was just funny. That could work in a more lighthearted movie, but in this one, it felt off.

The suits got even more ridiculous, they're mega OP against firearms or vehicles, but suck against swords and arrows.

The VFX was all over the place, often I was hearing gunshots, but there was nothing happening on screen.

For some reason a blind man can beat an unlimited amount of armed soldiers, in the beginning they tried to setup some tricks for how he could do that, but that was abandoned after the first use.

There are characters that are set up to be very important, only to leave the story and never appear again, even when someone closed to them is mentioned, they are forgotten.

The black supporting character was cool, underutilized in my opinion."
9,"All the john wick films are incredible, but none are as good as this one. From the action that is so iconic to this franchise, to the incredible music score, and of course the incredible characters.

The action in this film is insane. I don't think we have seen any film as action packed as this one. Clocking in at 2hr54min this movie is very long. And you kind of feel that while watching. But the way they plant 10 minute long fight scenes keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.

The music in this movie is a game changer for this movie. Because of the music the action scenes and other scenes as well are on another level. The cyberpunk esc beats is fantastic. Love the credit song.

This movie is a must see and definitely rounds the franchise off fantastically."
10,"May or may not count as a spoiler but John Wick pilled up more of a body count than Jason Vorhees sure different genre yet both great killing machines! Chad Staleski created such a great action extravaganza quad of films and one of my favorite trivia's he was the stunt doable for Keanu Reeves in the The Matrix back in the day; fast forward to 2014 they work together on one of the greatest action films of our generation. John Wick 4 is ultimate experience that is a must see I can't praise enough for how much fun it is.

I might get vibes for my thoughts I tried not to spoil it's obvious the combination of kill count has added up the rest left to the viewers, the action and writing is incredible for Chapter 4 that everyone involved deserves praise! I'd like to say too I own all the John Wick films and every Matrix, I'll get this in 4K when available."
8,"I consider John Wick 1 and the 2 the better films, 3 was forgettable because of the turn to more hollywood pop and too much comic book type scripting (instead of the darker more realistic 1 and 2 with some comic book touches of lack of realism), although the action at the end of 3 with the famous asian martial arts experts was enjoyable (but not realistic) and the casting was good. This 4th installment was also a little hollywood pop or comic book for my taste, BUT, some of the action sequences were unique and fabulous: (1) the arc de triomphe sequence (street fighting in traffic), (2) the overhead no-cut sequence with the HE shotgun rounds, wow, (3) fighting a disguised Scott Adkins, very amusing if you know who he is, watch him in Avengement and the Debt Collector (1 and 2), those were great films, and (4) Donnie Yen sequences. The blind man capabilities were ridiculous of course, they should not have made him blind in the script, maybe half blind? The entire casting was great. The historical european sites (or sets?) were beautiful. But alas no perfection because of the lack of realism in too many scenes. Apparently Mr. Wick has unbreakable bones."
6,"In the perspective of an action movie, yes. It's fantastic. Grab a coke and popcorn, sit back, relax and see how Keanu plays one man army against the entire world. Bravo! But just think of the other side. The writers only thought about Keanu. However, what about the thugs who wear nice suits that have an invisible tech gimmick that makes you bullet proof when you cover your head with it. Nevermind that. It's OK. It's nanotechnology maybe. Just think about the thugs who swarm around Keanu but no single man can shoot straight at any limb. Forget the head. Thugs from high table or low table or flat table, it doesn't really matter. Just hire people who can shoot a man at least in the leg."
9,"These movies have always outdone themselves, but here we are with an actual ""epic"". John Wick: Chapter 4 continuously punches above its weight with bigger and better ... well, everything. The lighting is better, the staging is more impressive, the fight choreography is absolutely insane. The excess here is the point, and it's never been more satisfying. The entire Osaka sequence feels like a marathon; then he's gun-battling in a speeding Barracuda; and there's even a setpiece built around stairs. The man even fights a guy in traffic.

TRAFFIC!

I freely admit that I'm that guy in the theater that squealed when the nunchucks came out (and they weren't a one-and-done either, he just kept beating people!)

This gave me the ""Top Gun: Maverick"" kind of high; an impeccably-paced three hours of sustained adrenaline. I don't think such enjoyment of bone-crunching violence is normal, but I don't care. This movie was an absolute blast!"
10,"Best Movie ever seen. I thought chapter 4 will disappoint but not and this makes me Jabra Fan of John Wick. Entry of John Wick was awesome. I Love there concept. And I don't want to give you Spoiler, if Still you have not watched it, I will request you to Watch in so you feel the Movie. It makes my day.

10,"What a conclusion to John Wick quadrilogy. I couldn't have asked for a better ending. Absolutely brilliant action sequences, stunning lighting and beautiful cinematography. It has got everything. This movie has taken action movie genre to a whole new level and has earned the Legendary status in my books.

Chad Stahelski being a stuntman himself has proved why nobody could have directed John Wick better than he did. The locations where action sequences take place are carefully chosen.

I never write movie reviews but this movie forced me to write my first ever review on IMDB. I was in awe when the movie ended and left the theatre with a happy heart. It was perfect in all sense."
5,"While I understand this is an action movie borne from fiction, I'm not sure what the director was looking to achieve here.

Was this meant to be a video game brought to screen? Where the player, or in this case the protagonist John Wick, remains impervious to pain, fatigue or mortality while racking up a zombie apocalypse level kill count.

The plot had been set in the 3 movies leading to this final chapter...(for the sake of the franchise, surely he ain't dead or at least there's a John Wick Jnr he forgot about while he was out collecting bounties) However, I'm not sure if we are meant to have deduced that a utopia has been established by an overarching High Table, replacing the law as the civilian authority.

Mercenaries appear to have replaced NYC finest or the French Gendarmerie by the time this chapter rolled around, but we are left to deduce that this must be the case? Not a law enforcement officer was in sight, despite a rising body count across the cities, and a building being levelled. Nothing to see here, move right along... Even the ultimate mercenary 'Leon' in 'The Professional', ultimately came under notice before the authorities mobilised to stop one mans will to avenge the wrongs of society.

Action? Non-stop. And there were some big scenes, many being created in a digital studio.

We move from a crowded Arc De Triomphe, with carnage all around, but no distressed citizens. Just going about their commute blasting their horns at the gun wielding pedestrians.

The night Club scene appeared to be one borne to support the visual storyline narrative as opposed to anything close to reality. Clubbers continued to be 'slaves to the rhythm', despite everyone else participating in battle and bloodlust, at a level last seen in Braveheart.

Special mention to the scene covering the 220 stairs leading up to the Sacré Coeur in Paris, well it was up there with the ""bug"" kill in Starship Troopers.

It's a movie that's borrowed heavily from celluloid genre, Action, the Western, and the Anti-Hero, but using technology to replace John Ford like panoramas.

It was like ChatGPT had been asked to write an action movie script, you know it's fake but you just accept it and settle in for the ride."
6,"If you're a fan of the franchise, you would definitely get satisfied by the whole movie and by its ending. Even for an unprofessional eye like mine the stunts look so well choreographed and the way they're shot is so perfectly executed that gives you the feeling you're almost there(that's why I recommend you to see it on IMAX, if you have the opportunity). On the other hand, because of the length of the movie you could get exhausted by all the fighting or at least l did. That also made me think - okay, Jon Wick is a really well trained killer, but where is the source of its stamina, because I'm not sure if even a professional athlete would be capable to keep up with all of these unstoppable running, wrestling and fighting(don't forget that an UFC fight is at most 25 minutes). Nevertheless, if you watched and most importantly - liked, the previous parts, you should definitely watch the final(for now) chapter."
10,"Absolutely one of the best examples of fight choreography, (hand to hand, blade, Judo, Gun-Fu) in films in many many years. Without spoiling anything for those that havent seen it yet, it is an action movie masterpiece. From the opening parlay, to the crescendo. Even including what appeared to be a tongue in cheek commercial for a new Taran Tactical Innovations release lol. Skäarsgäard is stellar at drawing fan heat as the/one of the new bad guy(s). As a huge fan some of the directions of this film and its outcomes leave one to contemplate other entries ideas and/or spin-off opportunities with the loss of one of the best cast members. But, true fans of the Wick series should be more than pleased, I know I was. I was also greatly pleased at the near 3 hour run time, so I wasnt left wanting for material that would require nearly that time, shoved into the usual 90-120 min runtimes to appease to the TikTok generation. Thankfully this fleshed out well and completely. Enjoy folks!"
10,"JW C4 is the best movie in the franchise by far. I cant wait for C5. The move is action from beginning to the end. 2.45 running time goes very fast. The plot is well known, and it is done better this time. This is not a movie, it is art. This movie will stand as the best movie as CR has played in. If you love 1-2-3, this give you the finesse and thrill, all the other movies combined. We sat struck in the theater. The filming is ground braking. The sound is taking you inside of JW world. I hope to see this movie One time more in theater. A lot of details would be missed due to the focus you get in the scenes. This is must see for 2023. If you have not seen any of the other 3 movies. Go and see this. And you get a new friend. John Wick - all should have One friend like him."
3,"Saw this film with my friends, it's the first John Wick film I have seen. I'm all for action movie stars having plot armour, but this is next level. Superhero movies are more realistic than this. Batman is notorious for plot armour and compared to john wick's plot armour it's nothing.

First off - do the police not exist? How is there 30min of gunfire/explosions in a hotel in japan and there's not a single siren? Same thing in Paris - an entire night of warzone-level fighting and no sirens? None?

Has john wick evolved to be immune to lactic acid? How is he fighting, running, jumping for literally an entire night in France without rest, no water, no food, no breaks, and somehow is about as tired as Usain Bolt after running a 100m? Not even olympic-gold winning athletes have this stamina. And ontop of that, he has perfect aim and the durability of Deadpool.

Are his bones made of diamonds? Is he immune to trauma? How is he jumping face first out of the 4th floor of a building and walking off like nothing happened? Is his head made of shock absorbing Vibranium? How else is he falling multiple times down hundreds of steps, hitting his head, and still able to walk? I don't care who you are - if you are being run over by cars, smashing your head against concrete and jumping out of buildings all within 1 night - at the very LEAST you walk away with a few broken bones if not severe internal bleeding.

How on earth did hundreds of assassins carrying insanely heavy weaponry not manage to put a single bullet in his head? And the rest of his body is covered via a magical suit that somehow has infinite durability. Yeah, that's not how bulletproof suits work.

Somehow, John Wick can be hit by multiple cars and get up. But if anyone else gets hit by a car, they die instantly.

Does John Wick have the scavenger perk? Somehow, after firing thousands of bullets he doesn't run out of ammo?

Oh, and let's not forget the blind man that magically knows where everyone is and has aimbot. This guy is a daredevil ripoff but.. without superpowers?

The ending scene was drawn out far too long. Falls down the stairs 100+ times - just end it already. And after killing hundreds of assassins with a pistol, being hit by multiple cars, jumping out of buildings, he dies to a gunshot wound inflicted by a literal blind guy.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for unrealistic fighting scenes. The Punisher somehow killing 50+ people with 0 superpowers? Sure. John Wick killing hundreds after fighting for hours non-stop, after suffering numerous injuries that would paralyze or kill any normal person? No.

2/10. Camera work was good, that's it."
8,"The best thing about John Wick 4 is that they show you too much without showing you too much. Lots of fight scenes, action, guns and bullets make this movie one of the best action movies of all time. The plot as always is simple and action gets most of the praise.

But for me this movie isn't just about the action. It's about how they adapt in each environment. From Japan to USA. The movie is shot really well and that helps making the action even more entertaining.

And John, what can I say about him? Keanu does an amazing job playing the killer we all love. His determination to finally free himself is what makes him so good in this movie.

There are a lot of things about this movie that I could praise on an on but it isn't really worth it. You just have to watch and enjoy it yourself

Yeah,"
5,"The CGI has some bad moments (randomly placed 2d arrow). The story doesn't make sense from where it left off... I was expecting a very angry John Wick aiming for his old friend, that isn't what happens.

John Wick was supposed to be the best of the best and has been fighting his competition mostly in 3, but now we get a bunch of assassins with close to equal skill like they've come out of a happy meal.

The background stories for the new main secondary character's skills don't matter and are lazily written (one guy is stupid good + blind and is close friend to another person who is a close friend who you don't care about), so much so they've just slammed a bunch of expensive actors in the roles to sort of let you know this person is a high class assassin.

This movie sort of reminds of an university level art class, were the students study and and mimick the original but don't quite get it. The art style is very similar, but its almost as if it gets confused about being a dark serious movie or a dark comic movie (it flips between the two too often).

I loved 1 - 3, but this is not what john wick should of been like in quality or story.

**edit** the thing felt so comicy bad, that the end reminds me of ghost rider the movie."
6,"First of all, I enjoyed other Wick movies but this one is quite funny with all the action scenes in slow motion. Didn't they have enough time to practice so that we can see proper fights? While they are fighting, they move so slowly like they try to remember the next move. Haven't they watched what they shoot? Or are they really satisfied with the outcome? This is supposed to be a legendary action movie instead of practicing in front of the camera. No need to talk about the scenario because not even worth it. All was cringy from head to toe like someone woke up them up to shoot these scenes..."
5,"A good conclusion to this movie series.. I think, I was very attached to the character of John Wick, but I think that no movie in the series has so far surpassed the first movie, which combined action and drama, but the action later.. especially in this chapter did not succeed in this formula, as it was a very long film, it bored me many times.

And after I sympathized with John Wick as a strong or even superhuman in the beginning, from the second chapter to this chapter, I interacted with him as if he was a robot.

Yes, the action is very good, but the long fighting scenes did not present anything new, and their repetition did not make them the climax of the events, but rather a regular thing, as the fighting scene was repeated among dancers and among street cars... without any reaction, so that I could almost swear that the NPCs in GTA games will react better.

This does not mean that I hated the movie, but if I miss the character of John Wick, I will always go to watch the first part, which is the part that I will recommend to others with enthusiasm."
8,"The John wick saga has found a way to entertain while keeping things simple. The story line to date isn't overly engaging or riveting and that is why they're great and thats why they work. John wick has found a way to offer the action film fan, endless gore and viloance without some BS effort to be overly clever. The 4th instalment offers more of the same, but bigger and better. It can be cringy in parts but who really cares, the amazing fight scenes more than make up for it. I think if you loved the first films you will also love this one. Not sure what's in store for the future of John Wick.....as I've said already, hopefully more of the same."
1,"At least make this travesty SOMEWHAT realistic, for freak sake. This movie was ninety minutes way too long, and apparently this review is 462 characters too short. Scratch that, it's now 413 characters too short. Hold on, now it's three hundred fifty-five, err, three hundred twenty, uh, twelve, whatever. This is ridiculous, just like John Wick, Chapter 4. Talk about an utter waste of time. But you know what, I wasted dang near three hours watching that piece of horse excrement, I might as well waste a few more minutes tapping out this ridiculous review. And there it is, six hundred characters."
9,"Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeves reinvigorated the action genre, which had largely been replaced by comic book movies, with their 2014 sleeper hit John Wick.

What it lacked in budget it made up for in style and love for the genre. Gone were the horrible shaky cam closeup fight scenes and fast cuts, that had plagued the genre for over a decade, gone were the cartoon physics from comic book movies. John Wick was gritty, realistic, but full of lore and world building and fun little quirks like the stylized subtitles.

The sequels expanded upon the worldbuilding, with part 2 especially being an incredibly beautifully shot film.

After the somewhat weaker 3rd part I wasn't too keen on seeing part 4. How wrong I was! In terms of craftsmanship, production design, visual splendor, photography, choreography and music, it's the best of the series. What a rush.

John Wick 4 is a symphony of violence. Every scene is impeccably lit, be it with moving lamps, fluorescent tubes, stage lights blasting through fog and waterfalls, window blinds casting long shadows and even incendiary bullets splashing the screen with light and color. This movie is beautiful to look at. Every frame looks like it could be a painting. The colors are rich and lively, unlike the ugly, dimly lit, grey muck like modern marvel movies. John Wick 4 is absolutely gorgeous.

As for the action choreography, aside from maybe Mad Max Fury Road or old Hong Kong cinema classics, nothing compares to this. This is on a different level. There's one often mentioned scene where the camera starts at eve level only to eventually give us a bird's eye view of John Wick taking out a bunch of goons with a combat shotgun loaded with incendiary rounds. There are mirrors in various locations, allowing us to view the action from multiple perspectives at the same time. It captures the heart pounding feel of a video game and becomes almost too much to keep track of. It's overwhelming, but in the best way possible.

Speaking of pounding, the soundtrack is mind blowing. The trademark techno / electro tracks by Le Castle Vania are back, and better than ever, but they are mixed with rock and industrial. There's a fun french rendition of ""Paint it Black"" as well. The finale then suddenly has western motifs taken straight from the great Ennio Morricone. None of it matches, but it doesnt matter. It's fun and feels great.

However, by the time the finale rolls on, you feel as tired and exhausted as John Wick himself. Battered by hours of nonstop killing. The kill count is easily in the hundreds here, and this is one of the weaker points of the movie. At some point you become numb to the killing, and the bad guys rarely ever feel scary. They're too easy to kill. It would have been more efficient to have Wick followed by less, but more capable villains, and to have the movie be 40 minutes shorter. Did we really need two action scenes of him going up the same stairway to Sacre Coer? There are moments when the film grinds to a halt during the action scenes. Also, the entire opening act in Japan served little to no narrative purpose aside from setting up the villains. None of the Japanese characters show up in the story afterwards, and it feels more like setting up some kind of spinoff.

The plot makes little sense, but luckily it does pick up towards the end and the finale is great.

Donnie Yen and Ian McShane get the best character arcs. The standout performance is Scott Adkins. You won't recognize him at first, but he plays his role with such glee and spark, overacting just enough and just at the right moments to stay memorable and lighten up an otherwise narratively unimportant scene. His German accent is perfect, almost realistic but with an extra bit of movie villain grit. So much fun. Someone please give this guy some real roles, he's too good to be wasting his talent on direct to streaming low budget junk.

Come to think of it, he would be a fantastic lead for a spin off series set in the same universe.

In summary, aside from a weak overall plot and about 40-60 minutes too long runtime, this is a masterpiece. Along with Die Hard and Mad Max 4, this is probably my favorite action film.

It should have made way more at the box office, but presumably the long runtime hurt it there. Now that it's out on streaming and physical media, that shouldnt discourage anyone from seeing it. If you haven't already, watch this movie. But watch it on the biggest screen you can."
4,"Imagine a video game where you are shooting bad guys. Your hardware is old so everything is kind of slow and out of focus. The opponents are set to Easy and you installed a hack to give you invincibility and autoaim. And they come at you slowly, shouting, out in the open, with weapons that fire three or four bullets before they run out and they can shoot anything anyway. They use no snipers, no explosives, no traps of any kind. They can't even hit you when they're next to you and wielding a knife. And you try to fight them in a decent manner, yet your avatar moves like a 60 year old man and even with the autoaim you still suck. And if you somehow get into the many separate levels where nothing make sense, you get a big cinematic that takes you out of it. And because the cinematic is in 4k or whatever, it feels like slow motion.

That, my friends, is the experience of watching JW4. The style that people have applauded in the first movie has turned into a demented caricature, the fight scenes are ridiculously bad, the actions of the characters make no sense at all, the world described makes no sense. Not even the tongue-in-cheek references to The Matrix don't hit, because you know that if you enjoyed that film, you're now over 40 and it makes you feel old. The film is three hours of irrelevance.

And if you are among the people who I can't understand that rated this film anything above boring, just watch the end credits scene. It destroys the little joy that you might have kept watching this.

Bottom line: So many talented people worked on this film. With them on board, I cannot imagine a worse outcome. It's not even funny, it's just sad."
10,"This movie is unbelievable truly incredible and bloody amazing. It is the best movie I've watched for years it has non-stop, action packed, best shooting scenes I've ever seen. All actors were outstanding even the dead ones in the fighting scenes. I could not take my eyes of the scene especially the scene with the over 200 stairs in Paris and the car crashing scenes. I even loved the super dog especially when he peed on the guys head. John wick is way better and bigger storyline's than James **** franchise. When in trouble just call John wick there's no one else alive that can fit this role other than the man himself Keanu Reeves. Thank you so much for this amazing movie moment of all time!!!!"
5,"The first movie had so much more than this. I was genuinely surprised by that first movie: original, exciting yet realistic fight sequences, a main character and plot you were invested in, and although Keanu isn't a great actor, his lack of dialogue and a great supporting cast more than made up for it.

The 2nd and 3rd movies took us on a journey into this mysterious underground world, but set up more than it delivered. The action scenes were starting to get a little repetitive and unrealistic, but the intrigue of the plot kept us interested.

My expectation was that this movie would deliver a lot more with regards to story, but it fell flat. Nothing that was set up previously was resolved in a satisfactory way. The action scenes were ridiculous, the characters unoriginal, and the movie was just way too long. I was literally yawning as hundreds of supposed hit-men who couldn't hit anything were killed again and again.

Before this 4th instalment, I was thinking of adding the John Wick franchise to my Blu-ray collection, but now I will just buy the first one as it works well as a standalone movie and is far superior to the rest."
9,"John Wick 4 deliver's everything you would expect from a Wick movie, with great supporting acter's like Donnie Yen whom i have loved ever since Ip Man (2008) i have watched at least 10 great movies he has been in,he's a legend. If you liked the other movies you will enjoy this one. One different aspect to this movie is that there is no love interest,which i find quite refreshing as too many movie's old & new are spoilt by unnecessary love interest's that just go nowhere or twist the script into knots as they manipulate the story to somehow include the woman. Nothing about the character's is forced, there's no DEI or feminist b.s. So this movie should do well as people have been crying out for decent, non-political flicks."
6,"A bullet ballet with lots of overly long action scenes full of complex fight choreography. It looks and plays out just like a videogame - the protagonist defeats an overwhelming number of enemies, shrugs off damage like it is nothing and bystanders either don't exist or act oblivious to the ensuing violence. The setting always required a suspension of belief and realism, but this one with its bullet proof suits and vehicle fight scene was ridiculous. The settings are opulently stylish, the characters are outlandish and the plot is refreshingly simple, but it all felt a bit too silly this time around. Some sequences were entertaining, the support cast and their fluid alliances was good, the ending was rather fitting and although a long film, it didn't feel it."
8,"My weekend ended with finishing the final installment of the John Wick series. I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.

The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole ""tracker"" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.

However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.

While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as ""loving husband"" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.

I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings."
2,"I am a huge fan of the Wick franchise. I knew what Chapter 4 was going to deliver (or not) since I no longer go to the cinema, but rather wait for movies to stream. As others have said before, the plot is thin and in the background. The fights are front and center, are too long, and get tedious. I had to split the movie over two nights to make it through...and this comes from a guy who will watch Chapters 1 thru 3 every time they're on tv. This was a sad struggle to sit through. The stellar cast was wasted in this sequel. I see many complaints about dancers in the nightclubs or cars around the Arch de Triumph not noticing the kills around them. Since Ch 1, I've assumed this is an alternate reality (like a video game) where assassins run amok around the NPCs, and that is how it is supposed to appear in this version of NYC or this version of Paris. They are not the same versions of these cities if we were to travel there on vacation, so I can get past that. The script for this movie could not have been more than 5 pages of dialogue. Besides the repeat of ""I need guns. Lots of guns."" and ""Yeah..."", there isn't much else. Winston gets off a one-liner now and then, but that's it.

As a mega-fan, I cannot recommend that other mega-fans spend their 2 hours and 50 minutes on this steaming pile."
8,"Wow. I don't know if they WILL end it there, but if they do it was a damn good note to go out on. Keanu Reeves is his usual great self as John Wick (honestly, he wears the character like a favourite jacket). The stunt team certainly earn their money, keeping the blistering action sequences just the right side of outright ridiculousness! The whole thing is very well written, with a great ending that shows just how/why John Wick is so dangerous! Nice after credits sequence, too - I completely forgot about Akira! I wonder who her intended target is - Caine, or his daughter? The daughter would actually make more sense as poetic payback for Caine's killing of Akira's father, and would probably punish him more.

8/10

RIP Lance Reddick.

Looking forward to the prequel/sidequel, Ballerina."
6,"I really don't understand how this movie garnered such a high score. I felt like I was in a Star Wars sequel with people either running or being shot at for almost 3 hours. Cinematography was fabulous and it did take you to other countries in a realistic and enjoyable way, however, so if you could sit back and enjoy that, it was worth it.

I believe Keanu Reeves' immortality outperformed Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon series after being shot about 84 times, thrown down flights of stairs multiple times and off buildings - and no - the Kevlar suit wasn't convincing to me.

Whereas blind people can do amazing things, Reeves' love-hate relationship with a former friend was not convincing.

In college, I learned that fiction still works if it is at least somewhat believable in its own setting. This one missed the mark."
9,"Ecstatic. Esthetic. Artistic. Cathartic. Masterfully filmed, designed and visualized. Quite possible the most sensually intoxicating cinema experience I've had. A simplicity that feels almost poetic. In the midst of all the action, you suddenly question the meaning of life. Only to then again fall back into John Wic's gun-fu exstasy. Like clockwork. On and on. Keanu Reeves, who has maybe 2 pages of dialogue in the entire film series, manages to embody a character that is fascinating, questionable and yet understandable at the same time .

There's hundreds of action movies. And yet there is an abundance of action setpieces in chapter 4 that have never been put on film before.

The magnum opus of action craft.

A loving husband."
10,"It's awesome to see how John Wick franchise has progressed, four movies in and it still has that same aesthetic, top to bottom, this film was just amazing. The editing was spot on, the scenery and focal shots are amazing, All of the actors were outstanding, the effects were some of the greatest I have ever seen, and the variety in the fight sequences was refreshing and new.

The director and writer really nailed the action and entertainment in this movie. Honestly I was little worried that they couldn't keep up with the franchise going at such a high level, I'm glad it was not the case with this one."
1,"This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...

What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see ""John Wick"" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The ""John Wick"" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no ""real world"" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.

Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.

Also, the ""Gun-Fu"" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.

Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.

Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is ""the best action film of all time,"" maybe you should rent ""The Raid: Redemption"" or ""The Raid 2."" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent ""Atomic Blonde."" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to ""the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action."" ""Atomic Blonde"" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...

Anyway, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die. Score: D+"
10,"I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help)."
10,"If you love John Wick, you will love this film. This is a beautiful and appropriate end to the best action movie series of all time. John Wick 4, like 1-3 before it, is pure entertainment.

Everything in this movie not only ""works"", but it wraps up one hell of a four-film ride. From the opening scene to the closing credits, John Wick 4 met and exceeded all my expectations. That was no small task - not because my expectations matter (they don't), but because this movie had to tie up a lengthy, complex, and ever-growing story in a way that honores the quality of the first three films while doing what each John Wick film does best, making a unique story fit perfectly within a broader movie universe.

I can't promise you will love this movie as much as I do, but I can promise, if you are a fan of John Wick, you will absolutely love this film and you won't spend $16 any better way than buying a ticket to see this masterpiece. Go watch it!!"
9,"Where do I start, its got it all, u think your watch action, western vibe. Cinematography is so good, scene stunning, story line do very well. KR plays JW very well indeed all that training pays of with all the action scene, it reminds of better tomorrow film, its got 2 action legend support cast, a dog who u fall in love with. It's 2 hrs 40 ish mins but time fly so fast with this stylish dark action thriller, I like the electric light it got that 80's feeling. I need to watch it again there alot to take in, lovejoy back, the bad guy french plays it great, the car chase and fight scene on the roundabout is a different level. So people don't walk run to watch JWC4."
6,"The fight scenes were terrible. Looked absolutely fake. This movie series should stop. Turning into Fast and Furious. The people at times were waiting for Keanu to turn around before throwing the slowest fakest punches ever. The punches Keanu was throwing didn't look remotely real. The nunchucks scenes were crazy bad. This movie is not good.

It is so stupid that you have to write so much in order to leave a review. There is no need to write a paragraph in order to review a movie. Especially one as trash as John Wick 4.

Crazy people acting like this movie is good. By far the worst of the franchise."
3,"This movie was quite a big disappointment. The whole movie is just way too long and barely anything happens. The action scenes are basically the same thing over and over again and are so unnecessarily long that they get boring to watch. The dialogues are terribly written, with many characters verbally explaining the plot instead of showing it. The plot is also nothing special and just feels more or less like the previous film. The film is also overstuffed with many never-before-seen characters, making it quite confusing. The movie is also so unrealistic, with John Wick surviving multiple gunshots and runovers."
10,"After so many unnecessary movies and series that flattered all segments that did everything for the sake of being watched, you really came out very good. THX!!!

It was really exciting I didn't understand when the 2.50 hours had passed, a few scenes were really, really exciting, I'm tired of making movies just for those segments where things are really constantly shown, it feels so good to watch a real action movie.

Some of the actors come across characters that we never expected and do their job successfully, giving unexpected performances.

I left the hall with a smile on my face and in a fun way, thanks to everyone who contributed to this film."
10,"Anything that you do is everything Consequences Without rules we're animals All distilled down

Wow, wow, wow! What a movie. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made .Afraid to say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is perfect and a masterpiece in every aspect. This movie proves everyone wrong. I can proudly say that this is the best action movie i have ever seen on the big screen. Nothing can be compared to it.. must watch movie..Keanu Reeves' exceptional performance takes the action sequences to an entirely new level, making for a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. The Best Action Movie Ever!!!. One of the Best Movies Ever Made ."
10,"John Wick is one of the best action franchises in modern cinema. When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.

Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotline Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.

Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.

What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.

Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry). Whatever they do, if it is the same quality as the John Wick movies, then I will be first in line to watch."
8,"I'll have to admit that, having been a fan of the first two, I was a little disappointed with ""Parabellum"". I felt after a stellar start, it was a bit too long and some of the repetition in the fights was a bit wearing. It's interesting about the way movies work, that I too felt this was overlong, and repetitive, but it ends (rather than starts) with such a phenomenal series of action moments that I feel much better about it than I did the last one.

With John Wick (Keanu Reeves) touring the world damaging the reputation of ""The Table"", they task The Marquis Vincent De Gramont (Bill Skarsgard) with finally bringing him to heel. Having extracted a terrible revenge on The New York Continental, Gramont blackmails blind assassin, and former friend of Wick, Caine (Donnie Yen) to hunt him down. Now a serious liability to his friends, Winston (Ian McShane) comes forward with a plan to free Wick from his debts once and for all.

I think I'd actually go as far as to describe the first two thirds of the movie as being lacklustre. It's only really Donnie Yen's reluctant killer that offers anything that we haven't seen before. Much of those earlier scenes seen Wick killing hordes of heavily shielded enemies, so again, as with the third one, the bullets are more to stun people rather than kill them outright. The Marquis sees Skarsgard, play aristocratic villain, which again the series has done before, though not perhaps with someone struggling as much with the accent as he is.

There are some raw moments with Lance Reddick in these early scenes too, who, as ever, was great.

The last third though, from the moment he steps out of the subway into Paris and battles across the city is phenomenal. It's a breathless action scene that lasts around 45 minutes, barely pausing for a moments respite. It seems him use cars, motorbikes, and all sorts of the weaponry to fend off assassins sent to stop him reaching a certain destination and it really makes great use of Paris as a character in the action. I must say, the scenes when he uses ""Dragons Fire"" bullets is perhaps the most video game thing I've seen a movie do. All the earlier inertia is blown away by perhaps the best sequence the series has ever done, and I do think that I probably feel warmer about the film because it ends with it's best sequence, whereas Parabellum opened with it.

I think I'm happy for the story of John himself to end here. We've got a couple of spin offs that are in development that can keep the world going, but I'd really struggle to think what more they could do."
3,"Broke one of my personal rules of avoiding movies longer than 2 hours. However, finding myself alone for a few days, thought I'd tackle this 2 hour and 49 minute beast. I enjoyed the first 2 of the previous 3 instalments, so how bad could it be?

Where to begin. If this were a drinking game, and I took a shot every time John Wick killed someone, I'd be dead of alcohol poisoning before the first half hour.

Plot? Thinner than my favourite t-shirt.

Acting? As much as I love Keanu Reeves, this didn't exactly showcase his talents. All his lines could fit on a 4x6 index card. And most of those he did have, he growled through.

Cinematography and fight choreography? Top-notch, and the only positives in this overly-long monster. Points off though for not seeing a single bit of gun recoil from any firearm to accompany any of the hundreds of CGI muzzle flashes.

It's non-stop shooting and fighting. So much so that I found myself fast forwarding through much of it as the movie dragged on. Have to admire the toughness of the '71 Barracuda that Wick commandeers though. Despite being rammed head-on into a handful of stationary objects, and smacked in the rear quarter, it comes out without a scratch, other than losing both doors, hinges and all. They even ripped off the plot (or as the director likely would claim, ""Paid homage to"") the 1979 movie ""The Warriors"" for that sequence.

A Google search tells me that he kills between 140 and 150 people in this movie. Sadly and completely believably, he loses a pistol duel with a blind guy in the end and dies. Just as well as there's no way of coming back from this over the top pooch that completely ruins the reputation of a great franchise.."
8,"I just have to give this chapter of John Wick 8/10.

The action set pieces are absolutely incredible and some choreography must've taken days if not weeks to get everyone prepared for the scenes but some of the fights show how it could've been done tighter ie an enemy in armour waits staggering about for Keanu to return and finish him off...keep an eye out and you'll notice this a few times.

The inclusion of the new characters brings freshness to the movie and the don't feel out of place could've done with a bit more of a background to them though.

John is carrying on his journey for freedom while taking on the Marquis DeGramont & his henchmen to arrive at a certain destination by sunrise and the journey there is just non stop action.

The pacing of the movie runs perfectly and you never get tired or bored, each set piece shot perfectly near enough especially the Arc De Triomph

The ending of the movie is and will be decisive to people and for me I'm happy with the ending and hope they end it here...don't know what to think about the end credit scene though !

If you loved the first 3 in this franchise then I believe you'll thoroughly enjoy this chapter from Mr Reeves and Mr Stahlelski."
8,"From the dog to an action epic that, with absolute certainty, changed the face of the genre in cinema. There are 170 minutes of little talking and a lot of beatings, shooting, lunging, more shooting, cars, motorcycles, dogs and anything else that could become a weapon in the hands of John Wick (Keanu Reeves), his allies and enemies. Here, the script by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch is inspiringly economical. Wick decides that he will take revenge on everyone, he discovers that a new representative of the Summit, the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsgard), has a plan to kill him, which makes the protagonist look for new (old) allies.

Even for one of the longest chapters in the saga, it's how Stahelski presents the few moments of pause before the unbridled, pulse-pounding action. The section in which the film prepares the action sequences and signals this with a play of lights in the photography orchestrated by Dan Laustsen, is accurate in determining ""the return to the game"", and how there is a path of pure chaotic beauty that makes up the different scenarios and that this is far from becoming tiring; it is an escape into violent, visually attractive and now less sumptuous entertainment, but which continues to rely on aesthetics as the principle of reality with increasingly absurd figures. Therefore, the script written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch doesn't make an effort to deepen the plot, it just knows how to organize the necessary elements to drive the action.

And for the same reason, this is how the insertion of new characters always works, since they are pieces based on the mythological Baba Yaga, but who manage to play satisfactory roles within the action time without overshadowing the mysticism with which John Wick moves with little words, but packaged in the characteristic black suit and fighting techniques. With great simplicity, the script does the task of expanding the endless figures that make up the High Table in this long dance number that extends between characters, settings and choreography. It's as if it were a game governed by its own rules, which are still little known, but which serve the spectacle of a masterpiece action film that is proposed. The dynamics of scenarios jump from New York, Japan, then Germany to Paris without losing sight of long, fascinating shots of increasingly challenging action.

There is no intention on the part of the directors to sign the film with anything that is not available for the action scenes and plot threads. The transition of environment within the scenes is always masterful and never leaves the viewer lost. Something tremendously important in a film where its action scenes last dozens of minutes and cover huge areas while John Wick is beaten and beaten to an amusingly frightening extent. Wick faces cars on the streets of Paris, then a crowd of villains in an abandoned house, but Stahelski and Lausten's camera makes a point of flying above the action in a plongee (camera from above) that cuts across the environment as dozens of people appear from four corners to kill Wick. And all of this culminates in the climb up an almost mythological staircase, just like that, without breathing or letting anyone in the cinema come up for air. Added to this is stunt work and choreography that transforms the film into an incredible ballet of violence. The timing of everything in the scene is wonderfully well thought out and executed, all in exciting harmony with the stylish sets and production design work that makes everything seem made for each other. The big nightclub in Russia brings together a huge crowd, but nothing ever seems out of control or without function.

The Continental hotel in Osaka is beautiful, as well as the sequence there demonstrates the enormous effort to show even more deeply the mythology of this world of assassins and the differences and personality of each place where this entire assassination organization still roams unseen by the eyes. Of the world. What's not lacking in ""John Wick 4"" is personality, each sequence, character and plot decision goes through this desire to be unique. And seeing something new in cinema in a genre is wonderful for fans who are so orphaned by this type of surprise, which also ends up being one of the best things you can find when you decide to dive into the dark of an action film. The traditional world of John Wick is new and completely fun. While the first John Wick was never about the dog, this fourth film is still about this man who can't find peace. Just that. To achieve this, it needs to become one of the most anticipated films of the year and a franchise that made the genre rethink its intentions. And whenever this happens, the spectator wins.

The sequence - set to an atmospheric soundtrack by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard - of a chase and fight in the middle of an underground club in Germany, complete with an exquisite game of lighting and slow motion, is just one of the insane examples of the stylish and Stahelski's creativity, always seeking to renew movements and plans to new levels. In this sense, this is where Stahelski's directing control is concentrated, which makes John Wick an outlier among titles in the genre in composing an epic film full of climaxes. The scene that unfolds at the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris, is another example of the metrically calculated way in which the action takes place in the franchise, where extras are not just extras, but fundamental pieces for the visual spectacle of destruction, violence, physical clashes, of the opponents who appear in vain to take down Baba Yaga in exchange for a reward, and also, it is an example of how Stahelski references the genre - with direct nods to western films - while exploring his own style in language and mythology.

If we accept the cheating and absurdity with a smile on our faces, it's because we already know in advance that bending the rules is essentially the only rule that matters in the ""John Wick"" universe. This is the agreement that films have made and renewed with their audiences, and the best features - the second chapter and now this ""John Wick 4"" - are those that most openly disdain the expected rules of the realistic urban chase film. In the 2014 film, everything was still being worked out; In the third, the concern with exposing and extending the mythology seemed above all a distraction. It's almost ironic that, with its nearly three-hour running time, ""John Wick 4"" is being received in the media as a spectacle of exaggeration, because all the choices the film makes, based on the rules it breaks and recreates for its convenience, are guided by the essential. There is no narrative fat left, no distractions; Characters have their profiles assigned according to the action opportunities they can offer, and everything boils down to getting from point A to point B without much dialogue, without much explanation, and in the most impactful way possible. The slow and affected monologues serve as a narrative breather and also to create expectations, in the Sergio Leone fashion: each dramatic pause in Keanu's speech will be compensated later with the accelerated and explosive action that we already crave.

When ""John Wick 4"" places an entire telephone exchange for the assassins' syndicate at the top of the Eiffel Tower, we accept this information as a fact of the real world without the need for further explanation because we know that this Paris is part of a simulated reality built on top of lots and lots of broken rules. To get as close as possible to the dynamics of action games (where we accept without question that reality is bending to fantasy and new laws of physics), John Wick has increasingly abolished everything expected from a ""realistic"" narrative"", starting with the very need for expository dialogues. Keanu Reeves has never said so little and has never been so physically demanding as in this fourth film. The only realistic thing that needs to be established in the film - and without which none of this would be justified - is the physicality of the fights. The impact needs to be felt as something real. ""John Wick 4"" benefits greatly from its martial arts-trained cast (Donnie Yen needs no comment), and the work of the stunt doubles on set is successfully mixed with CGI to create action scenes that appear to have real impact according to our laws of physical. Well, the only serious problem with this fourth chapter is that, with this length, it can't help but be an indulgent film. One gets the feeling, especially at the beginning, that some scenes could be shorter and could be better linked to the whole. About 20 or 30 minutes less and the result would perhaps be even better.

But this does not compromise the experience, which relies on the fact that the viewer considers the sight of a well-dressed Keanu Reeves killing people as one of the genuine pleasures of modern cinema. If you don't think so or if the previous ones didn't do anything for you, it won't be this fourth ""John Wick"" that will change your opinion. However, it is the spirit of celebration, of spectacle, that remains: a saga that began unpretentious with an actor whose career was stagnant became, on its own merits, something made to be enjoyed on the big screen and capable of bringing great satisfaction to fans of genre cinema. After all, it's not always the case, but sometimes, blockbuster cinema really manages to give the viewer a gift. Achieving a refreshing level of creativity in his direction, Stahelski positions ""John Wick"" as one of the most innovative franchises of the genre, making this chapter 4 an action epic that reaches its peak by embracing the most insane possibilities for the sake of entertainment. And judging by the box office success of this fourth chapter and even though our protagonist has theoretically ended his arc, it's not at all difficult to predict new sequels on the way."
8,"When you start watching a John Wick movie, you expect it to be a non stop action ride. Thats true for this 4th chapter in the most John Wick way possible and we wouldn't have it any other way.

Keanu Reeves' silent assassin John Wick is always a treat to watch. People do complain about his lack of dialogue but in this setting it works to his advantage as the action tells most of the story. John Wick is a force of nature, something everybody fears to be the other side of his gun. And in this movie, its maximum carnage from him.

Can't believe that 4 movies in and the director Chad Stahelski and his stunt choreography team haven't let us get bored of the action yet. Its surprisingly refreshing in every movie and each builds on top of the previous one, raising the bar higher. The story's tightly knit too, so you feel like the fight scenes organically come out of it and never feel forced.

An amazingly entertaining watch, as expected from the John Wick movies."
7,"By the time Chapter 4 came out, I'd come to the realization that I have no memory of what happened in the last three movies plot-wise, aside from the ending of Parabellum. I don't consider myself feather-brained, so it must be the absolute emptiness that was in those stories that wiped everything out. After watching Chapter 4, I reckon I will forget it just the same.

The story is the same grandiose, mythical assassin society jenga that seemingly exists in a realm of its own, away from civilization. There is no tangible reaction from the rest of the world to anything that happens during their disputes. Every single move or action simply adheres to the rule of cool. Visually, the movie is indeed very cool, with vigorous music, great pacing in the fights, and a towering number of killers. This time, (I theorize, maybe the other movies did this already) it goes for a The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly motion of introducing three opposing players, Wick, Caine, and the Tracker. The goals of the last two and their actions rarely match, but what does it matter? The rule of cool is in action. Under this rule, flashbangs do not make you deaf and disoriented just because you are unable to see to begin with. This is videogame logic. Cool one-liner, though.

The fights are immensely ferocious, even if, in some cases, the obsession with long takes makes the fodder goons act silly as they farcically delay getting up just to match their queue for when Keanu turns around. Not that I'm advocating for some Bourne hogwash again, with a shaky camera and cuts extravaganza. God knows we had a fill of those, but those techniques did exist exactly to thwart that kind of awkwardness.

The other ultimately frustrating thing are Kevlar suits, which I had grown to despise by the end of the movie. If the problem of goons not hitting your lead guy is solved by making them hit him but ordaining it to mean nothing, then you should probably reconsider how you approach the action scenes with a high number of guns all together. Not that the movie goes overboard with Kevlar deflection. There are many scenes of gun porn where it is irrelevant, but the fact remains that trying to mix realistic reloading with this kind of foolery does not work.

I don't know what happened behind the scenes for them to decide the seldom amount of spoken dialogue by Keanu to be delivered with all the implications of him having brain damage as he inadvertently makes awkward pauses between every word. It is an unintentional comedy regardless. Keanu's sole acting in these movies is his physical body language during the fights, as far as I'm concerned anyway.

It is enjoyable, mindless, stunt-heavy lunacy, as it was intended.

Hopefully, they will let him lay down and pursue new projects themselves, preferably with any kind of script that isn't just an assortment of locations to fight in."
9,"This thing is a powerhouse in the action genre. Directed by Chad Stahelski and starring the one-face-to-rull-them-all Keanu Reeves, the film delivers an electrifying experience from the very first shot. One of the film's most impressive aspects is its action sequences, this thing DOESN'T HOLD BACK, the fight choreography is a work of art, expertly crafted and executed with precision,handcrafted by a stuntman himself, and that just about shows up every time there's punches in the frame, showcasing a keen eye for detail.

Also to my surprise, the film weaves a compelling narrative as it delves deeper into Wick's character, exploring the emotional toll of his violent lifestyle adding further depth to the world of assassination while also conveying the internal struggle of a haunted and determined Reeves.

As for the visuals this is a feast for the eyes that captures the gritty underworld in all its dark and atmospheric setting, boosted by a sleek production design making each frame a work of art.

This thing sets a new benchmark for the action genre, exceeding expecationts at every turn.... you should watch it."
2,"I felt asleep for 5 or 6 times while this movie last. Well I was tired so if I was not so tired maybe I would fell asleep for 1 or 2 times only. The movie is very easy to predict, have nothing to make you think about. It started fine, but then it went on continuous cycle that spin over and over again for more then 1.5 hours. And this simply killed all of my desire to watch. I cared not if the main character will survive. Actually the only thing I cared for was if the dog will survive.

And OK, this is action movie and so on, but the level they went to make him unstoppable is ridiculous. Marvel can take notes for their next super hero.

I will keep it short and just say that ""enough is enough and unfortunately this movie overstayed its welcome, by far"". Previous movies are better, this one is the poorest of all. I expected something more, something new and got a repetitive boring cycle. 2,5 / 10 By the way the Chinese actor was way better suited for Wick's role."
6,"By making this film a 3 hour monster they removed most of the urgency that was felt in the earlier films. The action is stunning but the majority of it goes on for longer than it needs to and can occasionally get boring. Also, I know that he's supposed to be unstoppable but some of the scenes stretch those limits WAY too far (all I will say is ""stairs"").

I will say that when the camera goes to the over the top view it changed from good to outstanding, but this unfortunately was short lived and ended with another stretch of the limits previously mentioned.

Hoping to see more urgency and maybe a little more originality return in the inevitable John Wick: Chapter 5!"
10,"Phenomenal. The action is as gritty and phenomenal as the past 3 films, there's still some of the campiness and unreleastic bits of action like 2 & 3 but the realism is still phenomenal, the story is much better than 2 & 3 it introduces 2 very interesting new characters and has such amazing world building added in that adds to the franchise and overall the story finally gives John wick actual reasons to fight once again. The movie is amazing I personally found some scenes dragged on a slight ammount but it's a very minor issue because of how good the story is and action, 10/10 movie 100% recommend watch all the John wick films."
10,"Constant action with Mr Reeves in rare form!

From start to finish the storyline is true to the John Wick ! Exactly as you would want.

Doing all those stunts is amazing and fabulous! It's nice to know that the writers stayed with the show. Will probably buy this when it comes out on dvd. So sad that the movie concierge in real life is no longer with us. I hope that sometime in the future there is another version of this, with Mr Reeves of course. As in the Matrix I am excited at the possibilities. Endless dialogue and ideas. Even down the road these John Wick movies will stand up as terrific entertainment."
6,"Now this is an whole lot better than ""John Wick - Paracetamol"" (2019) but it is still not very good. This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful ""Marquis"" (Bill Skarsgård), who has managed to get those at the ""High Table"" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting ""Winston"" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the ""Marquis"" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for ""Wick"", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game. Indeed, for almost all of the action sequences here the whole point seems to be: kill as many of the useless, hapless - but heavily armed - enemy as you can whilst perhaps bleeding a little from the mouth now and again. Use your finely tailored Kevlar suit to deflect bullets, blades, flames - just about everything as you, inevitably, survive against constantly insurmountable odds for well over 2½ hours before a denouement that is, admittedly, quite quirky. That involves a sort of Sacre-Coeur version of snakes and ladders but again, luckily, against innumerable would-be assassins who couldn't hit a barn door with an Howitzer at point blank range. Skarsgård isn't remotely menacing - like a poor ""James Bond"" villain in a perfectly measured suit, Laurence Fishburne features only sparingly and the whole thing has as much jeopardy as the 'Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Reeves does not act here, he performs - and the profusion of CGI, the complete lack of any police or domestic military in Japan, Paris or New York to address the increasingly chaotic and damaging carnage being caused in these locations all just wanted me to start shouting ""thwack"" and ""pow"" at the screen. There is a delightful twist at the end, but it's a very long time in the coming and to be perfectly honest, I was just a bit bored. I've never really been in love with this franchise, it's all too repetitive and predictable - and sadly, this is just the same."
10,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the most exciting,hyperkinetic and beautiful action movies ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has make a name because of this franchase. Chad has crazy,modern ideas. We see how Keanu was saying about 300 words but on the right spot. Baba Yaga is fighting versus High Table and we see Marquis who is Bill Skarsgard. Wow!!! He actually was the right actor for this role. I was shocked by Akira she deserved series or movie. Winston again with crucial role in this movie. This movie is D category or 16+ and this have a lot of blood and fights. This movie is perfect deserve to watch!!!"
8,"John wick chapter 4 has everything an action flick has to offer. The movie runs almost 3hrs and you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off for even a minute.

Bill skarsgard was a nice addition to an already perfect casting. Especially Donnie yen stood out of all the others. Also Shamier as Mr. Nobody was fun to watch.

As for the fight sequences, Keanu Reeves has given his everything to it and it reflects well in the film.

Another standout thing is the cinematography of the movie. It has some brilliant shots especially the final duel has amazing cinematography.

Overall John wick chapter 4 is undoubtedly one of the best action movies ever made and will be an absolute treat for the fans."

9,"Was that the same girl from the warriors? I know I can look it up but I haven't heard anyone mention it The same song The same boppers The same profile of the face But her lips look thinner but I guess that can be age Well it was an awesome movie and see it Fun Fun And more fun.. Run and see it or walk and see it or drive and see it or take a bus and see it . It's long but fun and more fun and good and see scream 6 also that was very good and see that movie ans run to see it or drive and see that movie also or take a bus and see that movie also.

Dungeons and dragon's was good also.

But see all 3 movies . Yeah yeah yeah."
7,"And so the story of Wick continues. And it continues to be stylistically Tarantinoesque. Brutal fight scenes are highlighted by well-paired popular songs.

But the action---which centers around Wick's battle against the entire world of assassins, it seems-feels like a throwback to the ""Enter the Dragon"" days of Bruce Lee, with one man against impossible odds. And the Asian influence permeates most every scene, even when the action leaves Asia.

There is also what might be a reference to the blind swordsman. And one opponent is named Caine, which could be a reference to the hero from television's ""Kung Fu""

Though wick is forced to reduce his life to a series of deadly eliminations, he maintains scraps of his humanity, particularly when interacting with animals.

But make no mistake: this film regales in its stratospheric body count, however artful the executions."
10,"John Wick Chapter 4, directed by Chad Stahelski and stars Keanu Reeves as the main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10."
6,"Well thats what john wick movies are. If you find it fun to watch a lot of shooting and fighting these are your movies. I watched it with my teenage son. Went out of the theater twice during the movie to get some popcorn and a go to the toilet. Did it deliberatley during the fight scenes. Didnt feel like I missed anything. Wick rolling down the stairs reminded me of Neymar. How dumb and boring was that. Before that, he fell from a 5th floor to the street and got up without problem. Even my son found that to be too much. The New York Russians appear to be in a Catholic church. Baba Jaga they keep refering to is not the bogeyman. Its an old woman, thats what baba means. Something like a witch. But whatever. The good thing in the movie are some colorful protagonists. I cannot but think these people giving 10 stars have a vested interest to do so."
1,"I was so excited at the first because there were many good review about this movie.... But, When I watched it....so boring....and really illogical...no story...just hitting and shooting around 2 hours. The first chapter of this movie was a legend...good story and really strong characters,,,,this movie is just bland..and plain..I dont know why people like it...if u like action movie for all day long please watch ninja assassin...that was better action than this...so disappointed and out of my expectation...u fight with the blind and u struggle to shoot him...lol...really dumb...dont waste your time."
10,"It is so much attractive for other 3 chapter.

The beauty is on of the places. They were stablish the places were so gorgeously. They give there a raw vives.

Also away in actions. What a mind blowing action they did. The awesomeness in 200 stairs action is also.

Everybody give there best on it.

The movie is not waste any kind of times.

It is so much great full to make this awesome movie.

The climax and the ends is very nice and sad full.

In movie every single moment give gusbamps.

The street fighting is also a insane. And there are also have some funny moments. Everybody enjoy this movie very much.

Thanks to make this movie."
10,"John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet."
4,"In my opinion this is by far the worst movie of the franchise. It's just way too over the top. Everybody seems to have magical jackets now to stop the bullets.

Audience loved the dogs on the third one so that just lazily copied one here also but didn't bother to have any real cool scenes with it.

I'm happy they made John Wick 1 but since then every movie getting worse and worse. This one was already so bad that I regret spending any money to see it.

People shooting and dying in center of Paris but police doesn't seem to care.

John Wick getting shot, falling from great heights etc without any issues."
1,"I honestly have no idea who in the fresh hell rates this movie so highly. Why? For the love of God, why?

The fight scenes were slow, unrealistic, stupidly comical, and the blind man wins all the time in a world where assassins exist.

Don't get me wrong, the first John Wick was awesome, but the rest was pure poop, and this one was poop with a crown.

The CGI was extraordinarily bad. The fights don't make any sense. The story... oof, the story is something else. There were so many times anybody could have killed John that it's not even funny at this point. I had to fast forward at least 60 minutes of this movie; that's how bad those fight scenes were and how many opportunities there were for anybody to kill John. The assassin with a dog had several, not just one, but several occasions for a straight shot at John, but well, he couldn't kill John obviously because it would ruin the duel. What a poop show.

It's very sad to see John Wick end up like this, and it's baffling to me how anyone rates this dog poop so highly."
2,"To many poor decisions. John Wick the indestructible man versus daredevil.... No sense of peril, no consequences.... Everyone has bullet proof suits, but not one of the countless disposable useless henchmen thinks to maybe aim for the head?? I get it's a movie and get John Wick is a man of focus..... But walks away from getting hit by so many cars I lost count, literally falling out of buildings... But then dies from a mere stomach wound....... Loved the first two, was just about ok with the third, but this one was too far for me to stretch I am afraid. Just cant understand all the rave reviews..."
10,"The best fking movie in all of the John wick franchise .Action sequences top notch , got a 15 minute continuous one take action sequences. This film got guns, cars , dogs , class , suit and motherfking iconic characters .The action done by Keanu Reeves was the best . The director's love for neon colours is clearly seen in the movie and the all the mythology about the high table, continentals about different hotels throughout the world the leaders who control it the rules on which this big assassin world works which the high table even cannot defy. The tone of the story is set from the start by the death of two important characters we know this time that the stakes are real and it is the best one till now .

Those who cling to death live. -John."
3,"""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is a film that offers what its trailer promises: action and more action, achieving a product whose production is outstanding, colorful cinematography and risky camera movements, as well as outstanding editing work and a soundtrack well done. Its big problem, the negative point, is the most important part: the script, which is repetitive, tired and unimaginative, exploiting the action theme without really having a coherent story. Everything ends up being absurd only with a good job in the fight choreography. An overrated film, practically bad and with an excessive duration for the null story it tells."
4,"JW4 has received rave reviews from critics and audiences alike but that's a mystery to me. JW1 introduced us to the world of the Continental, JW himself was tough but vulnerable and funny and the fight scenes were like nothing we'd seen before. It still had one foot in reality.

But from JW2 onwards Mr Wick has become indestructible, an unkillable superhero with magical powers. Sure there were some good moments in 2 and 3 and some wonderful choreography but for me, everything that made the first instalment so amazing is missing from JW4. The humour has gone and many of the set piece fights look like they were shot during rehearsals when they were being practiced at half speed. You can see the stunt men waiting for their cue to attack. Worst of all though, it's boring. I had to turn it off and go back to it the next day. The bullet proof suits are ridiculous and reminded me of the missteps of the Bond franchise before the Craig reboot - (invisible car?) Keananunu is obviously older now and can't throw himself around like he could back in the day and maybe this is one of the problems. The biggest though is that when the protagonist is indestructible there is no jeopardy so therefore no interest."
6,"A true John Wick fan here. Unfortunately, this is the least of the 4. What I liked about the other 3 was how the close combat was portrayed. 1 is a 9, 2 is a 10, and I give 3 an 8. S if I give 4 a 6. In John Wick 4 it is more in the open and it just doesn't feel the same. The fight scenes are just not as good as in the other movies. It's a decent film, especially the scene with Scott Adkins is good (he steels the show, give this man a spinoff or his own movie), and the scene with the shot from above is awesome. The cinematography is great, but it just doesn't give me the vibe that the other movies had.

However, a must see if you want to get closure for the franchise."
6,"It's just simply not the sequel to fulfil everyone's wishes, but after two fairly dull instalments following the original revenge action-thriller model, the fourth chapter in the John Wick series is violent, slick and shocking. However, that's not to say that this movie comes without its flaws. Because even with its overlong runtime weakening the actual product, there's still some other issues that block it from ranking higher than the first film.

But if you've paid the entry fee with a craving mainly for kick-ass action with Keanu Reeves at the centre, visually striking direction and with a lack of care for sensical plot, you're in luck. Although each are usually several minutes too long, this film is loaded with the most distinctive and hooking combat fight scenes located throughout the entire franchise. For many, watching John Wick brutally shoot up a bunch of bad guys in a very stylistic fashion is entertaining, but the amount of damage taken by the characters is also where one of the film's most distracting plot holes roots between.

The reason a lot of the action scenes are all-fun-with-no-suspense-or-excitement is because it seems that damage and brutality doesn't really apply to John Wick, where everyone else he fights typically dies at the instant. He can go tumbling down a humorously long staircase and get shot or stabbed, but he can always get back up with seemingly no impact from the injuries. The motives presented by the characters is also a sizeable issue, giving the movie what feels like so many convoluted purposes to the point where the whole project could've just been thrown away and forgotten.

Some will agree that within the context of a film review, the critic needs to get the positives in first and finish with the flaws. This review doesn't follow that order because John Wick: Chapter 4 is still a decent action-thriller you'd want to leave off on a good note from. Anyway, this film is definitely the best of the sequels due to the fact that's it's entertaining, more distinctive, the writing is much better and there's surprises along the way to await for. It may have a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it always feels like the plot is always moving forward, even if it gets a bit ridiculous at times. Performances by Keanu Reeves, Bill Skarsgård, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen also deliver some of the effect. If this is the finale to the overrun franchise, this is a solid way to come to an end.

10,"""john wick chapter 4"" whole new level of action set pieces

i wouldn't say this movie is a masterpiece, but the action sequences make this one a highly worth watch in theaters. What else does anyone expect from a john wick movie. The last one hour of this movie is just like blazing fire. Keanu reeves, i dont think i can see him in any other character unless he cuts his hair or something. He just shines in the action sequences and embodies this character completely. All the extras and other actors give an amazing performance. Action sequences, top notch. Cinematography, top notch. Music, top notch."
4,"Yes, I watched all 4 movies.

No, I didn't like any of them.

Yes, that makes no sense.

No, I can't explain.

Somehow, I hoped the next iteration of this series would be different. Have more story. Make more sense. But all 4 movies are well made fight scenes with a bit of story added to make it into a movie.

Now it did my head in how these movies get such high rating. Then it dawned on me that kids these days love watching others play games like Roblox or Call of Duty. This movie is tailor-made for these audiences.

The movie feels like a game with a bit of story with a bit of acting and then you fight. Kill all the bad guys from level 1 and unlock the story-scene toward level 2 until you get to the end boss.

So my 4-stars are based on this being a movie. It's slick and looks good, so that's 4 stars. But the other ingredients a movie needs, like acting, storyline and character development, are non-existent."
9,"Many plans to seek, kill and destroy John Wick but no one can!

Was that it? Send more! Bring it on!

An excellent and perfect sequel of the John Wick franchise.

Full of action and fight scenes as always - one of the best out there.

Main character - Mr. Wick is full of grit, determination, unwavering strength and hope for freedom.

I personally loved how Keanu gives life to characters he portrays - from Matrix series to this - and many other movies!

Mr. Keanu Reeves a.k.a. Jonathan / John Wick / Jardani / BABA YAGA / Boogeyman always deliver and never ever disappoint!

P. S. He's a #LovingHusband and #FurParent too!"
9,"I haven't read all the reviews, so pardon my ignorance if my comment is repetitive. I was highly amused by the director's ""borrowing"" of scenes from the movie ""The Warriors"" during John Wick's travails during his journey to reach the site of the final duel. Especially obvious were the scenes where lady radio announcer provided the play-by-play location of John while exhorting the mob chasing him to pick up the pace. It was such a flashback for me that I thought for a moment that it was the same announcer from ""The Warriors"", except she would be much older now. Maybe this and the whole final chase sequence were easter eggs provided by the director and producers as a nod to the original action-packed sequence leading to the ultimate conclusion. Then again maybe ""The Warriors"" borrowed it to pay homage to an earlier movie.

Otherwise, a great action movie for the ages. I was exhausted at the end, nothing was left on the table. If in fact John Wick is dead, it was a satisfying ending."
3,"Absolutely not the best of them. Maybe the worst. Painfully unrealistic, everyone wears literally bulletproof smokings and the elite guys were recruited out of gardeners, tax attorneys and university professors judging by their skill to kill with weapons. When in the first movie John shot each enemy a bullet in the head he now often feels the need to use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).

As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with this leaves all excitement.

And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the 4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's forgotten just 3 seconds later.

None of the characters have personality. Keanus text was probably printed on half a page and mostly consists of 2 syllabus-responses or the name of the person he's just looking at.

I really like and appreciate Keanu as a person and actor. I just wish the director would have taken this movie serious. I wouldn't want to rewatch even 10 minutes of this letdown of a movie. And it makes me strongly think that most of those 9 or 10-star ratings are bought while I am writing this comment on the first opening weekend."
4,"John Wick was never known for realism but was always centred around his fight for justice. We rooted for him. Honestly, this outing smothered all of Keanu's charm with his muddied motivation and a ridiculous plot. This film was well directed with great production values. But a blind assassin in an old fashioned, 'pistols at dawn' duel? BLIND??? TOTALLY silly. Characters like the Japanese daughter which went nowhere. Random black guy with dog? The same stuntmen killed again and again ( even in the same clothes). Great flame thrower, bird's eye, computer game action scene. But being run over 20 times and the longest ever ascent of the Sacre Coeur steps. Eugh. Way too long and silly. Bring back Keanu and a clear plot development. This was a disappointment."
10,"An unbelievable action sequel, a masterpiece. From screenplay to actions, everything is just amazing and awesome. It's basically every thing in one movie. Even the shots of the movie were taken so beautifully. It has everything that you'll ever want in an action movie, probably more. Watched it twice both in IMAX theatres and I just can't bear the fact that I have witnesses a lot, really a lot of John Wick but will not be able to see it further.

Every character did a fantabulous job, and I also would like to appreciate the scale of the movie and the grandeur that it brings to the table with such amazing locations and shot really really well. You will not regret once you go into the theatres.

John Wick is my best action movies of all time and would like to quote: ""John Wick is a man of focus, commitment and sheer will."""
4,"Well, the first one was real fun and is still the real deal, the other two I can't remember much of but that there was a lot of shooting and fighting and running going on. John Wick: Chapter 4 just provides more of the same and I must state - I was rather indifferent and slightly bored while watching. Don't get me wrong - acting is sufficient, production fine, and there is a lot of action, but the story, well, all that blabla about the High Table and so on, is just redundant noise to set up the stage for different and exotic settings for more bumbum. I really think they should have left the first movie alone. That one is still cool and hot but like the Taken (Liam Neeson) movies with every added ""chapter"" the idea and quality of the story and character thins out. And last but not least, almost three hours running time is something like an overkill ;)"
6,"Sadly, saying that this movie is the worst one of all the chapters. Apparently Keanu Reeves can't move like he used to, which is because of his age! A man who is 58 years old shouldn't be acting in such a movie.. he may be a family guy who is getting his daughter married or something not fighting here and there against gangsters and a whole crime organization!

I've been watching John Wick since 2014, which is 9 years from now, and whenever I get bored I just go rewatch this series over and over. Although my unconditional love for this series, I can't see it going down without saying it. I can't believe that I'm going to write this, but I don't wish to see another part of John Wick because it will be worse."
10,This movie was just amazing. The stunts are phenomenal. The action is amazing. Considering this film was nearly three hours long you would be surprised how quickly the film goes. The John Wick franchise some how manages to up itself in terms of action as each sequel is released. Some the set pieces used in the film were visually stunning and the fight choreography was terrific. I won't spoil anything although the third act was the best part of the film in terms of action and suspense. I personally think this is the best action franchise since the Jason Bourne films. Although unlike those films the John Wick film series has managed to not go stale whatsoever four films in. An easy 10/10 would recommend to action film enthusiasts.
7,"What can we even say about John Wick that we haven't said already. There was a lot of pressure on the 4th installment of the John Wick movie series, seeing as director Chad Stahelski has publicly stated that this will be the last installment of the John Wick franchise. Well it's safe to say that it has lived up to expectations magnificently. The action was nothing less than what we have come to expect from the franchise. The fight scenes are a thrilling, captivating, works of art that should be eligible for an Oscar on their own thanks to the jaw-dropping cinematography and direction. The characters and their overall storylines were clearly better than those of John Wick 3, but I have to admit I might be a bit biased as a result of some wonderful performances from Ian McShane, Donnie Yen, and Hiroyuki Sanada. Unlike Halle Berry's character in the last movie, these 3 characters that I just mentioned felt more alive to me. They felt real, each one unique in it's own way and style. And that makes me appreciate the writing of this movie so much more. The story, which truthfully felt a bit slow at times, was captivating enough to keep you engaged and on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. However, I have to say that the plot is in no way perfect. The movie has it's cons obviously, like some of the average dialogue and cringey one-liners. But trust me, that didn't stop me from having an enjoyable and emotional watch. It was an extraordinarily good series which got the end it deserved. I was crying my heart out by the end to say the least. A must watch for all movie kinds of movie lovers."
9,"I liked it a lot. Every John Wick movie is cool in its own way. I think that John Wick movies have kind of taken the place of James Bond movies. I would have given this a 10/10 but it is a bit slow in parts and very long. I understand they need to take the time to build up and down and they want to make it epic, but I personally think they probably could have shaved at least 20 minutes or even 40 and had it just over 2 hours instead of just under 3 hours. There is such a thing as too much of a good thing and I think 3 hours is long for any movie, even LOTR is a bit draining in parts and those movies are masterpieces. The action sequences are incredible. I love the way they combine martial arts, blades, and guns together in such a cool way. He even uses nunchucks and makes it cool. The locations are beautiful lots of night stuff with bright neon lights in Japan and Europe with classical music and fine works of art. This really is an action movie for the thinking man, unlike that Marvel trash the commoners watch. I keep thinking with every John Wick sequel I hope this isn't the one that finally jumps the shark and ruins the franchise but they have managed to deliver every time. I just hope they don't make the mistake of focusing too much on character and story. In every other movie that would be a good thing but John Wick actually hit on a fundamental truth that in action movies that stuff really doesn't matter, I just want to see lots of cool stunts and fight sequences with the bare minimum of story to hold it all together. Great movie. If they can get away with it and maintain quality I'd love to see them get all the way to John Wick 7."
7,"* Is this one of the best action films? - Absolutely!

*Is this the best Martial Arts film? - YES! In Hollywood!

*Is this the best solely action film of Keanu Reeves? Perhaps! I like Speed (1994) much more than everything else.**

*Direction: It's exquisite and surely an improvement over previous installments. There's more room for long continuous fight scenes and the car sequences are awesome too! The whole top angle fight sequence was so much fun to watch, and if you want more of that, go watch Brain De Palma's SNAKE EYES (1998).

> At 169 minutes, it's surely over-long by at least 20 minutes.

*Plot: The story is engaging but doesn't elevate itself with multiple twists and turns, much like the previous installments. The villain is somewhat dumb and we always know what'sgoing to happen next, even if we don't know how it's going to happen.

> Plus point is it keeps getting better and the ending my even be the best part of the entire thing.

*Cast: **Donnie Yen as Caine, the blind High Table assassin is the only fresh breath in the film making it entertaining, exquisite and emotional.

**Bill Skarsgård as the Marquis acts fine and dresses and better although the script doesn't allow him to be as sharp as literally any other character.

**Rina Sawayama as Akira has so much potential for possible future projects, but here she seems to have been nowhere near utilised.

**Reeves is of course the back bone of the film, giving his Career Best Performance!

* Costume design: In my opinion, the best part of the film. Especially that of Marquis, putting a richness to the whole thing.

* Cinematography: Almost every frame is breathtaking and justifies being set in night. Paris looks as beautiful as it did in classic Audrey Hepburn films (Charades (1963). Like the first 3 chapters had colours GREEN, BLUE & RESPECTIVELY, the YELLOW shines here. The stairs, the sunrise, the traffic, all are pleasing to eyes.

* Ending: >The ending could be interpreted in multiple ways, such as (SPOILERS) John died like said, or didn't and yet faked his death and went somewhere to avoid the underworld life and all the bounty hunters (like in Sherlock Holmes, where he is seen at his own grave).

>Though some are calling it the best part of the franchise thus far, I'll still place it second following Chapter 2.

>P. S. no offense to John Wick, but this film shows him a whole lot more invincible than even he is supposed to be capable of. Surviving multiple bullets is one thing, but falling from high story buildings onto metallic vehicles, and falling 200 steps? As a good film, this one deserves to have been somewhat more grounded or logical.

* Overall: > My rating: 7.6/10 > Rotten Tomatoes: 95% Fresh, 8.2/10 avg rating > Metacritic: 78."
8,"Right away, one thing I have said about the Wick movies is for whatever reason you can check you brain at the door. Not sure why but like other good action films to give it a pass on so many of the glaring weakness or far fetched things in the movie. But that is why they can be fun. Wick is basically a super hero without the fancy suits , well I guess one fancy suit, or magical abilities. I wonder what the official count is for the hit rate for bullets flying at him. I think is must be like a 0.1% hit rate. Maybe this is a prequel to star wars and all of the gunmen grow up to be storm troopers. Not to mention how many cars hit him. One weakness was the villain, most villains don't subcontract their work as much as he did but what do I know, maybe they do. All in all not a bad watch."
2,"There are many deaths in this filmic free-for-all. And assassins. Donnie Yen plays a blind martial arts expert, a role he knows all too well since he played an identical character in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. And that really sets up the debate around whether plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, or just a dumb, lazy rip off. There are references aplenty from the sci-fi/kung fu genres, including some of Keanu's own efforts. He knows kung fu-and shows us. It's kung fu'd up the wazoo. I imagine the director, a stunt man himself, simply Scotch taped together one fight scene after the next. FOR THREE HOURS! Three writers are credited with crafting 380 words of dialogue for Mr. Reeves. Okay, I read that Stahelski and Reeves stripped out roughly half the dialogue written for his character in the initial script. Accordingly, I would have stripped the writers of their entire salary. The first instalment featuring this legendary hit-man was just that, a smash hit. However, much like the Matrix sequels John Wick: Chapter 4 just gets on my wick.

Incidentally, the movie tagline is Baba Yaga. More appropriate would be jibber-jabber. (193 words, where's my check?)"
10,"Guy's this is fully entertaining action movie. Literally osammm movie guys. Bs ek bar theater me jakar dekho. John wick ki shuru ki 3 movies ki to hipe thi hi bhot mst thi. Pr ye bali last bali guys mtlb John wick ki hipe ko bilkul hi top pr le gyi hai. Guy's kasam se behtareen movie hai. Guys bs ek bar jao yar dekh ke aao review kya pdh the ho. Pagal ho jao ke John wick ke liye ye movie dekhne ke bad yar.

A sensational entry into the action heavy franchise that is ""John Wick"" & quite possibly the best action film in years.

Keanu is an extremely underrated martial artist and actor for his disciplined techniques. He definitely deserves all the praise for his stunts as-well. I go into each JW film with an open mind of appreciation for the martial arts & fight sequences, the films are guilty pleasures to me as I can't take them seriously at all. This is not a shot at the film or it's direction, having camp is not a bad thing though. Mr Wick has surely come a long way since losing his dog & wife in the first film. Regardless, definitely will always be there day 1 for any Reeves film and can easily say this is one of his best ever put to screen."
2,"Seriously, guys?... All that hype... For this!... I don't know why everyone is praising this movie... Maybe because it's the first "" masculine "" movie in a while... I'm with you on that... Can't even remember the last male lead movie out there lmao... But seriously, it's the worst out of the John Wick movies...long story short... It's a filler movie... Total lacklustre... The movie is unbelievably empty and predictable...most of the scenes are literally identical....maybe because there's literally nothing happening other than fighting! ... No story or events .... The movie is only somewhat watchable because the cast is awesome and charismatic! ...some of these guys are like 60 but they're killing it... Anyway... Another let down....so, let's see.... operation fortune.. Wack... Bullet train... Waaack... the John Wick finale...Sadly... also wack... Let's hope Mission impossible is gonna be different....and if you want a nice action flick to watch... I recommend wrath of man... Trust me it's good... The last one I actually liked and watched it again...."
8,"John Wick and all of the franchise colorful characters are back...with a few newbies. This film starts right where the last one ends, The High Table sends the Marquis to punish Winston at the New York branch for helping John Wick...this results in The Consierge Charon being killed and the hotel being blown up. The only way back is to team up with John Wick again. In his quest to get out, Wick has to challenge the Marquis through the High Table setting up an eventual Old West style dual.

Before the dual can happen...Wick has to get a voice to challenge the High Table through his Russian family, requiring a seemingly impossible job, and of course he has to get to the dual site.

This brings back the radio oddsmaker ladies, whose on-air spokes-personality is always teasingly tantalizing!

The sheer number of stunts in this film make this a must see. In the quest to get to the location of the dual...Wick must fight a literal up hill battle.

If the number of stunts isn't enough to convince you to see this film, there is also the amazing international backdrop which is stunning by itself. Modern, sleek and visually appealing there is a lot of eye candy to enjoy. One teaser, there is a new character called The Tracker who brings a new dog to the John Wick story."
1,"They need to end it here . This was a dismal attempt at whatever they were trying to do. The dark scenes where they hide john Wicks face so the stuntman can do the heavy lifting. Pooy shot and poorly written. John Wick needs to be no more. I am glad we only paid six bucks to rent this. And at that amount , I feel like I got robbed . The entire sequence of tnos movie makes zero sense. Keneau I am sure is embarrassed by this fourth chapter of what was a great series . It is getting to be like the Friday the 13th series. This is seriously one bad movie. The writers and director let us down terribly. Save your money."
8,"So i watched the movie in IMAX. The beginning blew me away already, punch after punch my head felt like it wanted to explode in the first minute of the film, whole Theater vibrated and set the mood for the rest of the movie. The action and fight scenes are incredible. My jaw dropped almost every five minutes into the action, creative teamwork and deaths. Good acting, and after all this seriousness, there are some funny moments as well that got a chuckle out of me. Incredible locations and mood switches, intense moments combined with the IMAX system was just so dope. Of course there were some unrealistic moments where a normal human would have been dead already, but it is a movie, so they got to keep Mr. Wick alive somehow.

Would recommend!"
10,"One of the best action movies in history. I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love. My score is 10 for the tribute to Keanu and John."
7,"I seem to be in the minority here but I thought that this was a very good but not awesome movie. As an action movie, it's amazing, but as a John Wick installment, I feel that it is somewhat lacking.

I enjoyed the fight choregraphy and I really appreciate them bringing in Donnie Yen, but I find that , when compared to the first John Wick for example, Keanu's acting seem to be much more cringe in this one. His lines are painfully forced monosyllabic and/or one sentence answers that seem to be almost FORCED coming out of his mouth, and seriously compare his dialogue with the first movie and you'll see it's night and day.

I also find that the movie has become a bit too bloated, with unnecessary fights being put in, with many of those fight scenes not necessarily involving John Wick himself, and a lot of plot inconsistencies are just swept under the rug (why was the Elder replaced? Why was he so easily reach and assassinated this time around? How have we never heard of the Marquis until now? What happened to the Adjudicator?).

The film is simultaneously too long but still inadequately explains the hanging plot lines while continuing to add new lore randomly out of nowhere.

The action sequences are still amazing, but now it seems a bit...tired, I may be wrong here but I found the action in the previous movies to be much more satisfying and punchier. In the end, I find that it didn't live up to its hype as ""the greatest John Wick movie ever""."
6,"John Wick 4 follows it's predecessor action scenes and evens tops with one of the final scenes. Still the movie feels bland in my opinion. Action scenes keep getting overly complex and you start disbelieving them due to their complexity. Chapter one worked because the action was (with some suspended disbelief) believable. As the saga continued we get a Fast & Furious problem where it just doesn't make any sense story wise or action wise.

Yes the action is well shot, the cinematic is incredible, but just no believable anymore. The movie fails in that respect.

Also the movie inside world of the High Table seems even more far off than before. Yes the High Table wants to kill John Wick. Now who is the high table? What do they want?

Control/money/power? All 3?

I would have enjoyed seeing the high table politics in action, seeing the network of high profile politicians under their wing working and making plans. Just Kill John wick is a lame motivation.

Also the Movie is way to long for the average consumer. Studios are trying to figure out why people don't go to the movies anymore? They make their movies almost 3 hours long and fill them with pointless scenes.

Still I enjoyed my cinema experience but I would have enjoyed it more if they made their movie more down to earth and shorter. Also if they showed more of the high table instead of 40 action scenes that are all mostly the same concept."
10,"This movie is amazing on all levels.

Best time spend in the cinema in a long long time.

So many perfect shots. Loved it big time.

If you like action adrenalin movies, you will love this.

I watched all the John Wick movies 3 times, and this will definitely get a rewatch when it comes out on blueray. This is a must have.

Great Cast, Great acting, Great koreografi, Great kamera angles, Great action, awesome music. Loved the tempo og the movie.

As an old dude (36), i'm very impressed with all the work Keanu Reeves puts his body through. I felt beat up in my own body, so many times during this movie. Keanu Reeves, just like Tom Cruise are some of the few, last real action Heroes <3."
3,"A funny or very sad movie?

I watched this movie with a friend while we did eat our ordered in dinner.

At first, we tried to take it seriously, but it got hilarious as the movie progressed. How many rounds can you shoot with a gun? Kill hundreds of people and not get hit by a bullet even once? Rolling down a 222 steps high stone staircase while hitting your head many times and then walk right up again to kill whoever is in the way? And a blind man who knows how to hit his opponents every single time, be it with a gun, a pistol or whatever. He even knows how to play cards and knows exactly which cards he puts on the table?

And then the sweet lips almost pressed against a 50's looking microphone keeping the swarms of hitmen, that all seemed to be tuned in on the same radio frequency, informed about the whereabouts of their mark? In how many movies did we see this before?

We could laugh about it all, but think about all these youngsters who take this as a possible reality: shoot everybody who is in your way and shoot as many people as you can. Seeing Mr. Wick as their role model in this brainless violence tsunami.

Well, I guess playing a role like that pays well. But still there are people in the States asking ""Why is it that we have so many (school) shootings in our country?"" Maybe Mr. Reeves has an answer to that."
7,"John Wick continues to fight for his freedom as the assassin guild he dishonored sends their very best to kill him.

These movies keep getting better and better. Similar to the Mission: Impossible and Fast & Furious franchises, the John Wick series knows what it does best and doubles down on the action, drama, and fight scenes in this fourth installment.

Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's Nobody are the perfect counterparts to Keanu Reeves. I wish we were getting a movie with all three of them fighting The High Table. Everyone was raving about ""that stairway scene"" when the movie first came out. I personally thought the poker game, and resulting fight, at Killa Harken's nightclub was my favorite scene.

Having said that, the action is some of the best I've seen (Sisu vibes). Reeves continues to dazzle audiences with his combat capabilities. Anderson has a fun arsenal. Yen plays yet another blind man with a deadly weapon. Bill Skarsgård was a good villain but I wish we had more from him.

If the franchise continues, I hope they stay as grounded in reality as they can. Some of the lines, characters, and gadgets had a little bit of a Bond feel to them. I don't want the John Wick series to suddenly become about gimmicks and snappy one-liners.

Prop I Want: The nunchaku John Wick uses Most Punchable Face: Mr. Chidi Favorite Quote: ""I want you to find peace. But a good death only comes after a good life."" - Shimazu."
10,"I really liked the movie, John finally achieved what he wanted and now we can only wait for the continuation of the movie with his best friend's daughter.

Let's hope it's soon.

The coolest thing was seeing him fight with his blind friend and having him help the dog of one of the guys who wanted to kill him.

An unexpected but fair ending.

The death of the actor who played bellboy at the continental hotel is sad.

And after so many deaths, we will never really know if John is alive or dead, but it would be great to know that he will help the daughter of his best friend to avenge his death even if the fight is with the blind Chinese."
9,"Best John Wick Movie so far. More actions in the movie. More interesting story. And mostly the last battle that's like the cowboy movie. 1v1. Men to men. So many places to get highlighted. And for god sake John Wick is frkin immortal. Enemy keep missing shots after shots. And there is Donnue Yen. One of my favorite actor. The battle music is very great. And mostly I like the part when the camera rotates like a FPS Tournament. They give you some rotating sort of effect and a top camera view. Totally like FPS tourney'and yes John Wick still love dogs. Best 2023 movie so far. But sadly it showed that Wick is dead. But hey, gotta be another movie because, Wick once faked his death (kind of). So looking forward to next part of this movie (If it's really another part)."
10,"💯100% MAJOR Spoilers Ahead: I had to buy this movie on Amazon Prime because the tickets were sold out, but I did get to see it on a huge 8K projector, which basically felt like a theater, so I had to watch it again. Anyway, if you're confused with my score, here's where I stand in each category: Story - 10/10 Acting - 10/10 Direction - 10/10 Pacing - 10/10 Visuals - 10/10 Score - 10/10 Resonate - 10/10 Entertainment or Emotion - 30/30 (This could obviously change in the future.) So adding everything up gets to a 100%

Obviously, I think every single category is stellar. From a story perspective, it's very heartfelt and has some lessons in life. Obviously John is trying to get revenge over the high table, but John and other characters in the movie start to question where this path of revenge will take him. His death was done beautifully and got me emotional. Everyone in this movie was shockingly good. Literally, every performance, Donnie Yen stole the show, Ian McShane was incredible, Bill Skarsgard was fantastic and was very threatening, Shamier Anderson was also incredible in this movie. But obviously, Keanu Reeve's gave a stellar performance in this movie. Every scene is choreographed beautifully. Every action scene is even more memorable then the last, and each one is better than incredible. When you get to the final few action scenes, there are some of the greatest of all time. The pacing is fantastic, each act is distinct and different, and none of these scenes feel repetitive. I seriously don't get that complaint. The visuals are the best they have ever been in this franchise, and the visuals for the first one are incredibly underrated. The final battle between Caine and Wick have some of the best visuals I've ever seen. When John is dying in the sunrise, I was and am speechless.

HOW ARE MOVIES THIS GOOD??? The score is as always incredible. I listen to the score for all of these movies all the time. It's one of those scores that just reminds you of how good the movie was. This movie stuck with me for the entire week when I first watched it, and now that I've rewatched it, I can't get it out of my head. It's that good. I've thought about this for a long time, but now I think I'm confident: This movie has the most entertaining action sequences of all time. Literally, I wasn't bored for a SINGLE SECOND! A SEEECCONND!!! I know that term get's thrown around a lot, but here, it's actually true. Literally, from the opening sequence, I was HOOKED. He's practicing his punches, and every punch, and every gunshot echoed across the room, and it provided for the best theater experience I've ever had. There were so many scenes in this movie where I got out of my seat, and wen't NUTS! There is also so much emotion in this movie, especially when you get to the end, my jaw was on the floor, but here, I actually mean it, there were so many scenes where I actually got teary eyed."
7,"As of now, this is the best movie of 2023; that being said, it still has it's issues. I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!

My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.

Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going ""Yeah..."" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.

My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.

Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed. I'd say this is a step up from Chapter 3, but not as good as 1 and 2.

7.2/10."
1,"It's hard to believe that Keanu is getting involved with the increasingly bad scripts. We simply double the kill rate per film by 200% and leave out the dialogue and plot. It's a shame. There's nothing left of the good first part. Speaks for the increasingly dull society who positively rated this crap. OK, they want 600 words for this crap.

9,"John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute beast of a movie. The gunshots sounded like poetry, and the fight scenes were like a dance piece. It is one of the best action movies I have seen since Mad Max Fury Road and the recent Mission Impossible movies. With all the current junk in cinemas and online streaming, I am glad we still manage to get quality movies because that is what audiences want.

I watched this movie in IMAX, and it was an incredible experience. The sound design was insane.

Just from the opening, I knew I was in for a ride. It starts with John Wick punching a wooden board, with one punch making a loud impact that shook and vibrated the whole room, all thanks to the IMAX speakers. Then we are re-introduced to the Bowery King, played by Laurence Fishburne, who delivers a monologue, with Fishburne's delivery making it sound Shakespearean. Wick continues to punch the board with each bang creating a build-up. They even did a match cut from Lawrence of Arabia, capturing the smooth scene transition.

Not only is this cinema, but a beautiful call-back to classic cinema. The previous John Wick movies had callbacks to the golden age of film that doesn't feel like a cheap love letter.

Also, I was worried about the nearly three-hour-long runtime, with the last film getting repetitive after a while. Thankfully, it did not drag, as it has a solid pace.

Keanu Reeves, what can I say about this man; Keanu is also 60 years old but shows no sign of it in terms of his physicality. On the surface, Mr. Wick is a cold assassin who will pile bodies on top of bodies just to escape the hitman world. However, despite playing someone famous and feared, Reeves has the saddest eyes that make him feel vulnerable. He elevates the character so much that if any other actor played John Wick, it would have been generic and dull.

New additions to the cast like Donnie Yen, who plays a deadly blind man, the type no one wants to fight because who wants to admit they lost to a blind man? There is a comedic touch to him how he uses his walking cane. Usually, when movies get legendary martial artists, they are often wasted or not allowed to live up to their most tremendous potential. In this movie, he is used effectively and gets to shine.

Rina Sawayama was a fantastic addition to the series, where she had some wicked action scenes in the first act. I am interested in seeing more of her character, hopefully. Hiroyuki Sanada, a familiar face you may have seen in other action movies, was great in the scenes he had. He is an actor and martial artist that I feel does not get enough credit that he deserves. Ian McShane is solid as always because he is Ian McShane, after all. Scott Adkins, AKA this version of 'fat bastard'. What a fun performance that was hysterical to watch.

Lance Reddick is not in this very long, but with the slim screen time we did get from him, it pains me to know that we lost such a stellar presence of an actor.

Bill Skarsgård plays an arrogant French villain that you dislike. Sometimes certain actors will be typecast in villain roles that you either roll your eyes at or say, ""of course"". Most of the time, it becomes an unimaginative and safe choice to shoehorn actors into a ""bubble"", because it worked out so well before, but here, the film did a great job of making you hate this guy, and with a good reason to. He's a rotten fruit of a person dressed in fancy and slick clothing to parade around his importance. At the start, it is clear he is not messing around or someone you should mess with.

Among the cast, Shamier Anderson was another stand-out performance/character with a loyal and bitty dog sidekick. I cannot believe I am saying this, but this is the only instance where I want to see spin-offs from these characters.

Chapter 4 has the best action, the best soundtrack, the best cinematography, the best villain, the best introduction to new characters, and the best climax.

Action set pieces that keep outdoing themselves. One set piece involved John Wick making his way up 220 stairs of the Sacré Coeur in Paris while facing off enemies, which was a sight to behold that my jaw was wide up during one part. It was funny and spectacular in execution. Or how about the Berlin club fight scene that was hypnotising and wonderful.

Despite how repeatedly John can be thrown, shot, or stabbed, he can never be taken down or killed. Can Mr. Wick die? Of course, he can. He does bleed, and I learned in Predator (1987) that if it bleeds, it can die. Personally, Mr. Wick chooses not to die, not yet. The movie makes him out to be a legend, a myth, someone impossible to kill in the eyes of other assassins. It could have been a Fast & Furious scenario where things get too stupid with every character being death-proof. On the other hand, what surprised me about this movie is how it leans onto the idea of mortality, hanging onto what is left of his life and wondering how long this can keep going; despite all the pain and tiredness that life throws at you. Your lead character, quite literally, has had enough.

There is something tragic and beautiful about these movies, but also freaking cool. John Wick movies are a golden example of action done right, and Chapter 4 is easily my favourite in the series."
10,"John wick chapter 4 is definitely the best action movie in John wick series. It is not only the best movie in the series but also the best Action movie ever made.

Overall John wick series has been the most beautiful master piece of Action movies.

John wick chapter 4, is a masterpiece from beginning of the film to end and to post credit scene.

On a personal level i may not be a fan of the ending of the film, but i was prepared for that kind of ending of this movie.

I Would like to see Mr. Wick alive in the next part.

Wil wait for bellerina and the continental to see what comes next in this movie series. I am hoping to see John wick in action. If this is the end, then Miss you BABA YAGA."
6,"I am a great fan of the first John Wick movie. A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.

He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.

----------------------------

This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!

In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!

He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.

Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).

Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.

Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.

So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat. Also the cinematography and music is really nice."
3,"Sure. A lot of action. But it really was quite...dumb. Sooooo much close range shooting and every one misses except the ""good guys""? C'mon. The acting was fair. Just the same John Wick as in every other John Wick movie. At this point, the movie has an 8.2 rating. I don't see it. This is Marvel superhero stuff. Hit by cars, shot, falling out of buildings and still...walking. Sorry, but a lot of action is great. But a lot of unrealistic, unbelievable action is for fantasies. It is as if all they wanted to do was pack in a bunch of Kill Bill killing times ten and call it an action movie. Long on blood, short on, well, everything else."
6,"Finally finished John Wick 4. Had to watch it 2 bits as too long and kinda tidious until the end.

It's not even a film. It's 3 overly long fight sequences that just drag on to a good ending. Like a video game reaching the big boss ending.

The special bulletproof vests and the fact you know he eill make it to the end means the fight scenes just drag on and on. I actually had to fast forward as the shooting scenes just never end. Some parts are good but even then they go on. There are only so many ways to shoot someone in the head.

What elevates the film are the non John Wick parts. Ian McShane is just brilliant for the part, Donnie Yen was a master stroke in casting as was the Malinois (Belgian Sheppard). Laurence Fishborne is good, as are Bill Skarsgard and the guy that plays the tracker.

There is no story, just how to take 2 and half hours to kill the bad guy.

Wick himself is a forlorne figure, seeking both revenge but also closure through his own demise. He lacks the thing that made the first two films great, purpose. And, well for me at least, I was waiting for it to end and I got the feeling so was Keanu.

As much as the fight scenes are too long, the final showdown is better than expected and also elevates the movie. It would be a 5 out of 10 stars part the other actors and the ending means I add another star.

Ovetall, an ok ending to the series but could do with at least 30 minutes of fight scenes removed."
2,"Like many other sequels this series is falling apart. There is hardly any story. All his enemies are brainless. No snipers in the whole series. 50 guys attacking a single guy but all forget to use the gun and start freestyle fight. Mr Caine is blind but no one can shoot him. The villain is stereotypically rich, arrogant but handsome who doesn't get a chance to show his fighting skills. His chapter ends with a single bullet. John's body is made up of high grade titanium alloy. He gets hit by a car 10 times, falls from the stairs 10 times, survives a fall from 4 th floor window, never gets shot in head even when bullets are raining..... Guys watch it only if you have nothing to do for 3 long hours."
8,"John Wick: Chapter 4, where do I even begin? This action-packed extravaganza certainly knows how to deliver stunning fight scenes and keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a worthy addition to the franchise, but like any good action flick, it's not without its quirks.

First off, let's talk about the positives. The stunts and choreography in this film are nothing short of mind-blowing. Donnie Yen's performance as Caine is nothing less than unbelievable. He fights like a blind man, and yet every move is executed flawlessly. And of course, Keanu Reeves is the embodiment of John Wick himself. It's hard to imagine anyone else in this role. Well, except for the few instances where his enemies conveniently wait their turn to attack him. I guess they must have gotten lost in the mesmerizing and brutal choreography.

Speaking of which, the action in this film is lightning-fast. It's a shame that so many people choose to watch computer-generated ""superheroes"" when they can witness the raw and thrilling fights between Reeves and Yen. I mean, who needs Ant-Man when you have John Wick? The sheer speed and intensity of the action are something that words can't truly capture-you just have to experience it.

Now, onto the not-so-great aspects. Clocking in at nearly three hours, the film does feel a bit bloated at times. Some scenes drag on unnecessarily, and there are a few confusing plot points that could have used more development. Plus, let's not forget the reliance on fan service and callbacks to previous films. While it's great for die-hard fans, it might leave newcomers scratching their heads.

Despite these flaws, John Wick: Chapter 4 still manages to deliver an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride. The world-building continues to expand, and we're introduced to intriguing new characters like Marquis and Shimazu. Don't get me wrong, Keanu Reeves is still an unstoppable force, even if he's starting to take his John Wick role to hilariously stoic heights. And let's not forget Lance Reddick's unforgettable portrayal of Charon, the courteous concierge we all grew to love. His presence will be sorely missed.

In the end, if you're a fan of jaw-dropping action sequences, John Wick: Chapter 4 won't disappoint. It's a satisfying conclusion-well, maybe-to one of the best action franchises out there. The breathtaking visuals, captivating fight choreography, and expanding universe make for an entertaining experience. Whether this is truly the end or just the beginning of more John Wick adventures, I can't deny the sheer joy I felt watching this film. And hey, if they ever make a John Wick video game, sign me up for some top-down shooter action."
5,"As a massive Wick fan I was really looking forward to this....and yet left thr cinema feeling annoyed and frustrated yet again by Hollywood's obsession with making films an hour longer than they need to be.

There were some beautiful moments in the film. Some of the tight fight moves were off the chart and Reeves athleticism is incredibly impressive.

The card playing scene was pure genius. The overhead cam shot scene in the old building was revolutionary and expertly choreographed. The negotiation for the specifics of the dual was wonderful too.

The idea of a blind assassin was also fresh and the ultimate dual scene was very well handled.

However, much of the rest was so repetitive it became not only boring to watch but irritating. Watching the same gun, knife, roll, fall etc 150 times is just pointless and boring.

The penultimate scene of JW getting up the steps to the dual was painful beyond belief. I mean come on ffs!! We've watched him spend the last half hour moving a mile and kill 200 men...just get there already.

JW 1 was so fresh and new its sad that we have now ended up with an hour of amazing cinema and nearly 2 hours of what looks like a kid playing a first person shooter.

Maybe the US audience love this stuff but for the brits it would be nice if they could edit out about an hour of the repetitive and unbelievable nonsense as it had so much promise and yet fell so short.

Usual problem of studio giving production total freedom to do what they like. Money money money over finished product."
5,"I was never a big fan of this saga, even though the plot of these films is always basic, boring and predictable, the first one was kind of innovative in terms of the action and fighting sequences, but the rest were just more of the same.

Then all this buzz and hype came from the fourth so I was hoping they did some sort of revitalization of the saga and the first part of the movie indicated that but then its all ruined due to the same reasons as the previous installments.

There's no difference between this and super hero movies when it comes to the realism of the action scenes, the main character is indestructible, he can take punches, knifes, bullets (BUT he has a suit / vest that he uses to protect his face as you do when there's a bit of wind so I guess that makes sense), dozens of the best killers in the world, you see the point, he is a 1 man army with limitless stamina and upenetrable plot armor.

All of this becomes even more ridiculous when the fight scenes become slower as Keanu also ages, I mean I respect the man for doing his own stunts and he does look amazing for his age but come on.... and the fact that these boring unrealistic fighting scenes happen and the background regular people are just unfazed by it, is this suppose to be the Matrix as well? It just adds to the unrealistic environment.

I mentioned the movie started promising because there was a lot of interesting dialogue and character introduction, the stylization of different cultures and cities was also done well but then its lost on the predictable and ridiculous plot all over again... With that ending we still expect John Wick 5, seriously? It's so sickening these movies keep gaining millions, this worn out franchises, why do we continue to support this stuff...."
9,"Total score compiled by: N: 10/10 M: 9.5/10 I: 9/10 F: 7.5/10

Reasoning (N); Absolute perfect way to not only do an action movie but also end the mainline run of a franchise with dignity. All of the original characters have a satisfactory conclusion to their character arcs and even newer characters make you instantly make you wish for a standalone movie to know more about their own story. I feel for all the people waiting for a slow moment in the movie so that they can go to the toilet because those scenes are basically non-existent. The scene elevating this movie from a 9 to 10 for me personally is in Paris when everything suddenly transitions into a top-down view (reminiscent of games like hotline miami). The scene then transitions back into the normal third person view and back again into the top-down perspective. All of this looking like a seamless one-shot. Sure, there were some noticeable green-screen shots towards the end but that didn't make the action shots before any less cool."
10,"This action movie is great, it's a way greater than all the previous plotless Wick's movies, it surely stands alone in the series. But, there is one huge BUT, there is a black spot in the middle of each frame, a black hole which intensely sucks and this hole is the John Wick and the hundred years old hairy wooden hippy playing John Wick - poor Mr. Reeves. Everything is totally WEAK about this character from his name to the person playing it. Firstly, Baba (Yaga) in Russian is a degrading word for ""woman"" equivalent to the words like wench, slut, broad, dame or hag if the woman is old and vicious which is the case of our Johny what makes him in plain English ""Hag Yaga"" - how stupid is that? Baba Yaga is a vicious old witch hag from Russian kids' folklore stories. It doesn't sound cool in relation to a coldblooded killerman, it sounds like Bubba Gump shrimp. It would be much coole to call him Kashchey the Deathless which is Voldemort/Sauron character from Russian folklore. And what is a Belorussian gypsy I'd like to ask the creators of this movie? There is no Romas or Gypsies in Belorussia only Hag Yaga - Lukashenko! Gypsies live in Moldova, West Ukraine, Romania, Hungary. The authors clearly don't know and don't care a damn what they are making the movie about! Ok, we can leave that alone. The worst part about this film isn't etymology anyway, but is that I laughed at every Mr. Weak's fight scene as bad as if I was watching Mr. Bean, and, believe me, that's not a good sign for an action packed dramatic serious shoot-em-up Kill-Bill movie. For the part of Wick with the same success they could have cast Adrian Brody straight from Polanski's Pianist. Old, stooping, bow-legged, hippy-looking, bearded and hairy Keanu Reeves is the worst cast an action film has ever known in the history of the world cinema! He should have played parts of scientists and musicians not roles of Steven Seagal. Every fight scene with Weak John looks crying-out fake. He doesn't mean it, he doesn't mean a single blow, he doesn't even try - he is OLD, he can't do martial arts and acrobatics and it's a torture to watch him trying. He doesn't produce an impression of lethal killer, he produces impression of a laughing stock, of a scarecrow on a stick. When I think how much time it is going to take the characters of Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Arny, Stallone, Jet Li, Jacky Chan or Black Mamba from Kill Bill to annihilate John to nanoparticles, my answer is from one to five seconds. You know how long would last a fight scene between Great John Weak and cleric John Preston from Equilibrium (2002)? - about one sec - and there would be three Johns Wicks. Even Charles' Angeles would beat all the dust out of poor Johny in ten seconds. The only main character from old action movies whom Weak John would confront without being killed instantly is John McLane. It would take about five minutes of some heavy fighting and a lucky chance for McLane to finish off the Weak one. All in all Keanu Reeves completely lacks what it takes to produce on screen the effect of a deadly threat, he only makes one laugh and pity him. It is clearly visible that when he throws some big bloke, it's not he who do the action, it's the stuntmen who jumps and sends himself flying, Keanu Reeves has little strength only to move his own hands and carcass through the air. Keira Knightley was wielding nunchucks better in Domino than this poor old superhero. And as an actor - he is not an actor, he is a log trying to look serious and menacing. In spite of all this said it's still a surprisingly good action movie from the old times mostly due to the good job of the rest of the crew."
9,"I can think of no other series of movies that consistently improves upon itself than the John Wick series. This fourth installment improves even upon the fantastic third movie. The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always, phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences. Make the effort to view this movie at the cinema, as you will get the full cinematic experience that this film needs to show all of the work put into it."
10,"What can I say I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish- this films keeps you on the edge of your seat with non stop action- it's a must see in the big screen to appreciate the action scenes.

Definitely want to go to the cinema to watch it again and again.

Reeves to the perfect actor to play John Wick the fight scenes are truly exceptional and Donnie Yen (Ip-Man) was marvellous

This movie makes you want to revisit the other John Wick films to soak up more action.

Baba Yaga is coming for you and be scared be very scared.

Ian McShane was also excellent as Winston what a fantastic actor.

Definitely a must watch."
10,"After seeing Chapter 4 for the fist time while just vaguely remembering plot of each previous movie I watched just once at the time they came out I didn't know what to think about it. Action, cinematography, stunt work and characters were all great, but I just didn't get the movie.

So I decided watch every John Wick back to back and see Chapter 4 again. And I must say, those movies really are one story told in four chapters (so far). They continue where previous left and build on each other really nicely.

And Chapter 4 is the biggest, boldest and the most beautiful of them all. I get the movie now and I think that it's brilliant, especially the final part. There is one location that feels bit weaker than the others, but I won't be lowering the score for that."
5,"I was very disappointed in JW-4 and stopped watching it half way through as it was tedious, repetitive and boring. Just hours of mumbled dialogue, dark interior sets and non-stop Ninja fighting. The fights went on for hours and they did not make sense as humans didn't seem to be killed by bullets or knives and there was no reasonable explanation for it---the bad guys were not all robots. The plot was murky and we already know that Keanu Reeves is a robotic, deadpan actor. I have no clue as to how this film got rated 7.9. Unless kids and teens, under 35 people love to watch gratuitous, meaningless, poorly acted violence."
9,The end does lose steam but this was a nice little punch to make it look better and the rest is good enough for me and you should have enough time for the rest should I get back with the other guy and let me see if you want me back and I'll let him look for the new awesome and let the man out and me too and I'll let him look for a new phone call me if he can send me the name on it and let him look for a good one of the ones I have to go with him and I can get them back and I'll be back in a bit and I'll let him look for the week and I'll let him look for the other day so I'll be home around like 10.
6,"Love the John Wick movies but this wasn't up to par. Don't get me wrong, the action is AMAZINGLY choreographed and filmed. All of them are. This one was just way too long and it's just insanely unplausible that any one armed man is going to drop hundreds and hundreds of assassins, even when huge groups of them all have a clear shot and yet most just wait their turn, like old kung fu movies from the 70s. Come on. There's so much non-stop fighting that it gets boring and you just wish they had put more effort into telling a story, building up characters more and building suspense and anticipation. Nope, shooting, shooting, punch, stab, boom, slash, shooting, boom, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat. Wait, is there going to be a shocking twist? Oooo, nope. Repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat annnnnnnd, the end."
9,"Thinking about this movie I'll tell you what I realized about it. We're basically watching poor John Wick get tortured for 3 hours. Shot at, beat, kicked, thrown, run over by cars, trucks, and fat Russians. By the end the guy is basically beat to death. Is this the story of a warrior or is it some kind of metaphorical journey through the circles of hell? I don't know. To me, it was the story of a man who has too much talent being used for that talent until it was all gone, and then being tossed aside when it was clear he had nothing left to give. I think that can kind of tell you what the story of the High Table is all about, it's the story of the abuse of man. It tells us how the rich and powerful use people up then stick them in graves with happy go lucky slogans on them. The irony of John Wick is that he knows what he's doing, who he works for, and how corrupt it all is but he doesn't care because he thinks they're all going to end up exactly where he does."
4,"I really can't understand how many people thinks its the best ever.

Its not. It was great until arrive to Arc de Triumphe, after this all scenes were way exagerated, he is not a robot, we could never take what he did, while others keep falling of very light hits.

The fall on top of the car and all the stairs scene, competely ridiculous.

In previous movies he killed with two shot (chest and head), now lots of times, in guys without armor, lots of shots completely unecessary.

The blind guy completely ridiculous, its not a Marvel movie with guys with super powers.

As an additional stpe, no way the Table would allow to any of the duel fighters to be touched before getting there, otherwise also John could kill that very poor marquis. No sense at all.

Its a pitty, nice fighting scenes.

And the end, COME ON!!!

Baba Yaga never dies, it disapperas into the mist, until he's needed again.

By far the worst."
10,"Wow, just wow. Every action and marital art enthusiast must go to the cinema and buy a ticket to see this movie. We've been ""blessed"" with so many movies lately that focus more on pushing some kind of political agenda or message, and here finally we get a movie that is just pure action. 3 hours of the best of the best. Wont go too much into detail of the plot, but just do us a favor and go see it in the cinema so studios will continue to make movies like these. Don't wait for it to come out on TV, don't stream it illegally, buy a ticket. Marvel and DC, write notes, this is how you make action."
10,"Brilliant and imaginative fight scenes, especially the ones with the blind guy. Love the hommage to The Warriors from 1979 where the sultry female d.j. Narrates his journey from the subways of Paris up to the church. I was transfixed for the entire film and felt that not one second of time or one square inch of screen was wasted This is what a successful franchise should be!

My only question/criticism of the movie was the introduction of the new character of ""Nobody."" He seems to add nothing to the story and we can only speculate at this time as to why they felt compelled to add him into the mix."
1,"The entire plot of this movie was utterly meaningless. John Wick accomplishes absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get away from the High Table, and all that sacrifice was meaningless in the end. From the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the pointlessness was the point.

Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.

People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before their eyes. I remembered enjoying the first movie, but giving money to this disgusting piece of propaganda was a mistake."
1,"John wick can crash agains 10 s of card, roll down flight of stairs multiple times and still survive.

Avoid the movies at all costs, and not mention hundreds of people of shooting at him one after the other and still does not die. John wick is basically in god mode in the movie.

John wick can crash agains 10 s of card, roll down flight of stairs multiple times and still survive.

Avoid the movies at all costs, and not mention hundreds of people of shooting at him one after the other and still does not die. John wick is basically in god mode in the movie. Totally avoid it at all costs, unless you have nothing else on earth to do."
5,"I liked to other John Wick movies but this one is the weakest. The action is repetitive and lack the 'humor' of the other movies. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this movie as they introduced a new female character and I wonder is this to have some kind of spin off or just poor story telling. Such a waste of Keanu Reeves as this could have been so much more rather than the 'cardboard-cut-out' of a more rounded character.

And yes we have all seen this kind of ending before, like a lazy day for the screen writers. Oh! I seen this in another movie we'll used that as the ending, think Gladiator but one hell of a lot weaker.

Keanu Reeves is one of the coolest actors and super good person, maybe he just wanted this to end and do something new, how about a good motorcycle movie now that would be worth seeing."
8,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is everything you can ask for in an action blockbuster, if I were to sum it up. We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.

Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!

Donnie Yen is such a kickass addition to this microcosm, both in terms of delivering high-octane action and playing a character that suits him to the T. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama get to be part of an exciting showdown in Japan, with the latter holding immense potential for the franchise's future. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots. Shamier Anderson and his ""faithful accomplice"" (a Belgian Malinois, played by five different dogs) are splendid. Also, RIP Lance Reddick (you will be missed!).

Scott Adkins, as the quirky-yet-menacing Killa, rises to the occasion as a secondary antagonist, with him beating the crap out of Wick in a stunningly stylized set-piece. Bill Skarsgård, playing the arrogant (primary) antagonist, is the ideal final boss. The hybrid score by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective."
7,"The main problem is that the sound design is excrement. They seem to think that 'moar bass, moar loud' is a shortcut to quality. It isn't. It's one of the most acoustically ugly experiences I've ever had.

The rest of the movie is fine. Appropriate acting, interesting sets, creative choreography and decent stuntwork. It has almost no story, relying heavily on pure action. Despite the hefty runtime, it manages to be a lot of fun - a solid entry in a franchise that has been consistently entertaining and consistently high-effort. Apparently this is the 'final' entry. Sure. Sure it is.

Just get a new sound editor next time."
6,"But still a good film. The originality of the John Wick movies was the realism ( or as close as possible ) of the action scenes. In this 4th movie the images and the sets are better but for a grown up, the fight scenes are sometimes hilarious in every way possible. Also, the fact that Caine is blind erases by half his credibility ... a must not have done in my opinion. Thumbs way up for Bill Skarsgard and Shamier Anderson. I don't know if they should have stopped at the third, it is still entertaining but it takes a down slide road of the saga. Not even close to the second, which I think it still is the best of all 4."
10,"John Wick 4 is one of my favorite action films so far, the film is very cruel.

Chapter 4 is resoundingly the best Wick sequel - but I still prefer cold-blooded efficiency over bloody excess, no matter how artfully and, at times, playfully staged.

The latest installment of the John Wick franchise offers a vast canvas for stunt work and action choreography with a sincere and brooding Keanu Reeves as the anchor.

John Wick 4 is an elaborately choregraphed, gorgeously crafted slaughter fest. A blood-thirsty spectacle. A circus of scoundrels fighting to the death in the most gracefully violent ways."
10,"It begins right at where chapter 3 ended, and John still trying to make the high table understand he wants to be left alone. And within a couple of minutes happens the only logical thing and bodies start piling up.

Without going into specifics you see stuff happen to the NYC Continental and the Bill Skarsgård character recruiting, more like forcefully dragging one of John's old friends in order to get the job done, and at the same time we're introduced to the Tracker character that has a cute malinois with him because we know how much this franchise love dogs.

THE ACTION Set pieces are insanely paced and the movie never lift the foot off the gas that even though the movie has almost 3 hours you won't feel it at all. The whole chase in Paris has John dispatching henchmen with ease drifting around and dodging oncoming traffic as the High Table price on his head increases pulling even more assassins. There's an scene inside a house after that with an overhead shot that makes it look like a video game and the whole theatre was laughing at how John moved around using walls for cover and using dragon's breath shotgun shells (not a spoiler as it was in many trailers).

It's not every day that we see a franchise get better with each film, specially with a sleeper hit in 2014 that was my favourite film of that year with reason. Watch this movie in the biggest screen available and don't go for a large drink because even though it doesn't feel like it's 3h long, otherwise you'll be very uncomfortable before the credits."
4,"Keanu Reeves was clearly too old to do this. At least two dozen times during this film he is performing his own stunts and the actors he is facing hold still to get hit by his slow old man punches and kicks or pre-react to his slow old man punches and kicks.

It looks bad.

Then they added a blind guy who is supposed to be like DareDevil. That was idiotic. The blind guy would have died in his first fight if the three cooks he was fighting didn't wait for him to 'kill' them.

Then there was the army of assassins that don't have a clue how to use a rifle. You are in a huge room. You have a rifle. Do you run up to fight the target in melee range, or shoot him in the head from a distance. These morons kept throwing themselves in front of John Wick just begging to die.

It is so stupid that it obviously was Keanu Reeves having way to much say in what he thinks would look cool. He is just straight up bad at this, and the fact that he has a fanatical following that provide this kind of echo chamber makes him look even more pathetic."
10,"What is wrong with half of yall that has comments on here like wtf? Hey least it's now a remake of something that's been remade 3 times or more before it. Let's see Disney didn't take and well go from live action over to cartoon and or vise versa. God forbid someone thing of something different ish for a change and not just hey let's remake this one this time guys.

Like hey lets everyone hope there hasn't been to much time put into already remaking say the Iron Man movies? Or whatever. Come tf on guys. Least everyone started something new and from ""scratch"" almost every single one of yall are just plan dumb !! !! Quit over thinking a fictional character,story and well etc.... I already know and realize plenty of yall won't like what I put here and I really do not care. Sh$t think hard do you or would you ? Probably not.

K thanks bye you guys k bye k k you guys bye good night bye you guys."
5,"This fourth chapter adds almost nothing to the John Wick franchise, born somewhat by chance and became a cult narrative for action movie nerds without thickness. The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all..."
4,"If you've seen John Wick 3 you'll know this doesn't have to do much to be a better film

It achieved that , it's a better film

As an advert for a game it did really well too

Positives were , slick fight scenes , music and sound was top notch .

Negatives far too long there's no excuse for making a film 3 hours long , no film should be longer than 2 hours unless it's a true epic , exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia & Ghandi - those films have a story to tell .

John Wick 1 was brilliant they could have ended up there but if you can make a film for $100m and make $200m then it's clear there will be a John Wick 5 .

If you enjoy films like Blade with Wesley Snipes you'll enjoy this , in fact with all the marvel films around I'm surprised they haven't brought out a Blade 4 with a new actor after the success of Black Panther

Like James Bond's immortality it doesn't matter what you throw at John Wick he's not going to die

Best acting goes to Scott Adkins absolutely superb as Killa in a fat suit I actually thought it was Tom Hardy at first ! This whole scene in the German nightclub was the highlight for me.

It's not a bad film , if this is your genre and you're a die hard ( ironic ) fan of Keanu Reeves ( he's made some amazing films point break being my favourite ) & John Wick I think you'll enjoy it . Just not my cup of tea that's all .

No spoilers as always

Better than John Wick 3

Pad. A 4/10."
4,"A dramatic step down in quality from previous entries in the series.

The main drawcard being the action sequences and gunplay. Sadly in chapter 4 they lack any stakes and become boring and repetitive almost instantly. Bullets have no effect or simply pass through people, stuntmen routinely stumble while waiting for their queue to attck then die, basics like taking cover take a back seat to flashy unnecessary spin that some one thought ""looked cool"". Many sequences just look like a bad dress rehearsal they decided to keep.

Unnecessary characters that add nothing to the already non existent plot. Streets or famous landmarks are completely empty or filled with bystanders that appear to be in a different dimension, oblivious to the insane acts of violence occurring next to them until it suits the plot or they vanish into thin air from one shot to the next. Not a single police car or officer called out the entire movie. In possibly the most unrealistic scene, an entire subway train in Osaka is empty. This is a movie that holds the same level of quality and planning you'd expect from a bunch of 7 year old boys playing bang bang in their back yard. ""My suit is bullet proof"" you hear them yell as you chuckle and sigh, ""ah kids.."" You really really need to switch off your brain to enjoy this 3hr slog, or just laugh at how poorly planned and executed the entire idea is.

I can understand people wanted this to be good and rated it highly because these types of movies are indeed in short supply these days and I also want to see more quality adult action movies made. But lets be honest, even with a high budget this is just plain old fashioned below average shlock. ""Wrap it up"" someone said, too bad there's no bow on this one."
5,"A lot of buzz and great reviews, more than what it is worth.

It's not a terrible movie, John Wick 4 was quite entertaining and had high profile actors that did their part flawlessly but I felt the movie was flat and not as well-written as the first or third. I understand that it is just a movie and to not take the action seriously but I grow tired of the completely unrealistic and at some times, down right asinine choreography. At every action scene, the hench men just stupidly flail around Wick 2 at a time while the other baddies wait behind for their turn, like hello? Realistically, John would be dead within 10 minutes of the movie from a sniper bullet, if the mafia was smart enough to hire one. There was a character who I felt had no purpose in the movie as they had no real effect to the story. This ""tracker"" person kept switching sides between trying to kill and saving John and didn't end up doing anything, poor writing. It just feels as if the majority of the movie was just for show and no substance."
8,"John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review

John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) is the latest and possibly the best entry in the action franchise that stars Keanu Reeves as a legendary assassin who defies a powerful criminal organization known as The High Table. The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.

The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsgård), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.

John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and protégé.

The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.

The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.

Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass."
1,"Throwing a gun at somebody hurts them more than shooting them with a bullet, apparently. The action sequences look like dance choreography. And a blind man proves humans don't need eyes for anything, much less shooting or sword play or ""watching"" loved ones. This is an utterly ridiculous piece of garbage. This is not Cinema. This is just shoot, kick, slay and whatever other crap you can come up with. And it lasts a whopping 2 hours and 49 minutes. Whoever finishes watching this must be given a gift, surely.

There Are Video Games And There Are Movies, What Is This? For this is just not cinema, Period."
7,"Mr. Wick, Cain, and Mr. Nobody (though Mr. Nobody's character did not have to be in this, to be brutally honest). Quite the trio!

Caine is expertly played by Donnie Yen, who I'd like to see more of! I also liked the Harbinger and Mia!

I'd say, for a fourth movie in a series, this one was done pretty dang well! At least a half hour could be trimmed from it with no determent to the story, but it is pretty much exactly what the fourth movie in this series should be!

And, I was exposed to a song I liked that I'd never heard of before - ""Les amants du dimanche"" by Lucienne Delyle! Thanks Mr. Wick!"
3,"Before there was a story, and a lot of shooting, now there is just shooting and no story pief, paff poef. Everybody's dead.??? Is this a metaphor for the current society? Did I mention the movie is way too long we watched this in IMAX and my ears were hurting from the gun noise. The fighting scenes are pretty awesome and the scenery is nice, but I think good movie needs more than justice this. I wouldn't recommend to watch this at home and not in the theatre. You can have a break and adjust sound yourself.. I do hope there won't be a sequel for movies of the same character must be enough. Just make a video game of it."
10,"The cinematography was some of the best I've seen in any movie holding up to films like blade runner and interstellar. The choreography is even better than the previous 3 films. The acting is even superb despite the other films lacking in that category, I was actually emotionally invested in this story more than I usually am during a movie and I walked away dumbfounded by it's surprising excellence. I would not have expected an action movie from a series known for being over the top and goofy to be such an incredibly well done movie, but it was. That being said, the film still manages to be quite funny and whimsical at times and is still over the top like John wick should be."
2,"I was a HUGE fan of the John Wick series. Yes, they are over the top, yes they are needlessly violent, yes the staging and acting is fantastic.... In the first 3.

OK, in the first 3 there isn't much of a story, but it is there, albeit a tenuous storyline. This is just... flat. There isn't a coherent story line. The secondary characters are really not even wallpaper. The main ""bad guy"" has ome from nowhere, and the whole thing goes beyond the realms of believability. I know the first 3 were pushing the limits, but this is just ridiculous. Running gun fights in the streets of Paris with zero police presence, an endless parade of fighting and killing. At least in the first 3 thee was SOMETHING that made it make sense.

This film gave the impression of being ""how much more money can we squeeze out of this franchise"". I am horrified to find that there is another sequel following the ending of this film (I won't say what it is as I can avoid a spoiler)."
3,"Aside from being too long, too repetitive and too silent(absolute lack of dialogs even from main character) it has some pluses like shooting in the desert, in the club, at the street so you can actually enjoy the picture. If you make a screenshot gallery out of this movie and watch it with a slideshow on your computer with some decent soundtrack you might enjoy even more than a film, actually. The worst part for me is character cast. The villain is Marquis looks lime like freshman student from Germany with big blue eyes for absolute no reason. Orthodox belorussians creepy and violent like some wild island tribe. It got 8,1 rating as I'm writing the review, pretending to be remarkable movie of the decade, it's not."
8,"Too unrealistic to be taken seriously but too eye-pleasing to be forgotten. John Wick 4 might have set a new standard for action movies.

This chapter is on a level of its own and I get the hype around it. We are presented with jaw-dropping choreographed action scenes and a mesmerizing cinematography and production design. The different shooting locations are just fabulous.

I would like to rate it higher but unfourtunately this movie defies logic too much. Moreover, you might never actually fear for the main character's life because John Wick is pretty much indestructible at this point, which reduces the thrill and makes the movie feel repetitive and pointless. Nevertheless, if you can put that aside, you'll have a great time watching this visually gorgeous movie."
10,"Ok, You Gotta End This Franchise now, After the Action Scenes in this, there's no possible way to Top the Action Scenes after John Wick 4. The Outlandish And Super Cool Characters, that Ending 👌. This was it.

Things I liked about John Wick 4 -

1. The Cinematography, Lighting and Costume Design were Beautiful to Look At.

2. The Dragons Breath Birds Eye View Scene was Very Good.

3. The Circular Gun Drive-By Car Scene was Astonishing to Watch and was Such a Good Scene.

4. The Circular Fights with Cars Driving By was Also a Good Part of That Scene.

5. The Blind Guy, at times, has Some insane Hand Speed with that Sword and Fists.

6. The Staircase Scene was Ridiculous but it was Shot Beautifully and Again, it Was Fun.

7. I really liked the Gold Teeth Purple Suit Guy and the Poker Game they Had.

8. The Main Boss Was Solid.

9. The Right Hand Man was on another Level. Such a Badass and Super Cool.

10. The Russian Woman was Dripping with Coolness, The Raven Slick Back Hair, The Neck Movements and Mannerisms, the Beautiful Jewellery, She was Super Cool

11. The Club Fight Scene was Ridiculous but it Looked Good. Again this Movie Felt like a Show.

12. I didn't Know how they would end the Third Act. The way The Ending Duel Panned Out, and the Laugh from ""Mr Nobody"" was a Nice Touch. 👌

13. Some of the Fist Fights and Combat Fights were Good. Some Great Hand Speed 👍

14. The Sound Design in the Combat was Really Good.

Overall, John Wick 4 is a Moments Based Symphony, Sort of like a Show, it has Some Good Combat, Good Action, and at Times Amazing Action and a Couple of Astonishing Moments, Specifically the Circle Drive-By Gun Scene from Wick."
5,".......except the plot is even more predictable. 80% of the same O gun fight scenes. How many times can you do the same thing, so boring and repetitive? I get it, all gun and no plot is its genre but at least hire some decent writers. Barely any new action or gun scenes. The producers are just milking this cash cow dry to the bone. This movie was 1hr toooooo long also. The only good thing was the music had good bass and fit the scenes and only if you watched in Dolby with the vibration seats.

3,"I hadn't watched a John Wick before. After watching ten minutes of this movie, I was relieved that I hadn't been missing anything. For those who just love seeing homicidal violence, John Wick is your ticket. Particularly for those loving guns and gun violence, this movie is a feast. The dead probably exceeded a hundred, or at least enough to start a decent-sized cemetery. It shouldn't be a surprise that gun violence is so prevalent in the US. As for other aspects of the film, stunts and special effects are impressive. These usually involve killing bad guys and chase scenes. The sets are also impressive in such cities as Paris, New York, Berlin, and Osaka. The plot has minor variations from the good guy - bad guy theme. Why they are good or bad is less obvious. Wick loves his dead wife and personal loyalty seems to matter with the good guys. A much stronger motivator for the bad guys is money and power at all cost. For that, John usually delivers a bullet in the head. I liked Ian McShane and Laurence Fisburne's acting in this movie, but Keanu Reeves seems a bit of a stiff. Caine and Mr. Nobody characters are interesting, mostly because their loyalties are unpredictable and seemingly capricious. All that said, I am not sure how the blind guy can see so well."
10,"I consider this in my top 10 movies of all time. This film is absolute perfection and the 4th film of the franchise did not dissapoint, it only improved. Everything about it from the action, comedy, story, and development feel just right. The fact the movie is very long only makes it even better to remember. I was curious how John Wick was going to top off the 3rd film, but the 4th was a massive improvement. I found myself just paying absolute attention to the action packed epicness John WIck was providing for me.

John Wick is one of the few movie franchises I will consider buying merchandise for."
10,"Keanu Reeves is my idol & he was made for this movie , bow down to the best action movie I have ever watched , the best from beginning till end my mind just blown away , cinematography with pure gangster music is something else to witness it.

Best John wick movie , Pure action Pure acting Pure badass character Pure heart from inside but can burn anyone whoever steps forward to hurt his one's , In the end I just want to say that thank you Keanu for delivering such badasss movie , now times Hollywood cinema downgraded a little bit but actor like you & Tom cruise bring back the Hollywood to its pure class ,"
9,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is filled with more action, fight scenes with even longer and more detailed choreography plus it's so insanely explosive that at this point there are definitely scenes that are getting very questionable in logic, but that's ultimately of little importance. Something unique and exceptional in this saga is the elegant violence of each scene and a well-handled villain. The movie was firing on all cylinders for (what might be) the final chapter and, in conclusion, I can happily say that the John Wick series is one of the best actions film series in decades. I'm so glad spin-offs are coming."
10,"This movie was and always will be awesome.

Fightscenes were amazing and smooth and had long and super atmospheric shots. The dialogue is very well-written and quite poetic and the music hits hard. Dark techno is top G of music. John Wick will always remain one of my favourite characters in any storyline or movie and his epic character has been brought to justice with the john wick movie series. The camera angles in some of the scenes are also super unique and the fighting style of Mr. Wick is iconic as well as the actors that have been picked for the roles. I would rewatch this movie again and again because its amazing.

RIP the legend.

Magnificent.

And RIP to Lance Reddick. The butler and the actor will be missed."
4,"I've seen all John Wick films but this really hit the bottom. I can live with the fact that it has no story at all and the world building stopped making sense years ago but damn, if an action movie is this boring then it's obvious that too many things went wrong.

Like many said before, the action sequences are just plain stupid and all of them look the same: stupid goons slowly attacking Keanu who moves even slower. The direction and stunts are lazy and boring and the characters are a sequence of memes.

Only the top down sequence inspired by Hotline Miami is top notch, but the rest is just plain boring."
10,"JW 4 has the potential to be the best of the franchise yet made. The screenwriting is more coherent and adequate. It introduces great new characters that could be developed more profoundly and discovered thoroughly. They have maintained the legacy of JW and its brutal nature meanwhile adding new notions like brotherhood, fatherhood and father-daughter relationship. Cinematography and fight choreography are perfect ; capturing dim theme of JW and its true nature. Caine and Mr. Nobody are fantastic characters that need further attention. For instance, as a fan, I'm eager to know more about his background and how he became blind. I also like to know more about Mr. Nobody's background and his ability to be a great stalker( in a way). I enjoyed Scott Adkins portrayal in the movie. He was well processed and his character is really gruesome. With all that being said, I think this one is by far the best one and if they end it here (which I don't think that would be the case), it'll be a great farewell to John Wick's world."
4,"Yes, I tried to make a pun out of the word ""Bewildered"" because this film seems like it tried to do just that- make a pun out of the actual John wick films. The first was undoubtedly the best- it was simple, realistic, unintentionally humourous and had a very clear goal. Then, it became a little over the top in the third, especially when he visited the elder and wanted to remain alive just so he ""could remember her"".

Huh.

Anyway, I had high expectations walking into the fourth instalment because I do love this franchise. However, it was far too much. The action sequences were shot well and choreographed fantastically but it was unrealistic even for a made believe world. Unless that was what they were going for? More of a Marvelesque/graphic 300 and Sin City- Zac Snyder type vibe? It was no doubt beautiful in terms of Sets, costumes and cinematography and ok, really do have to hand it to the stunt and action choreography team.. if there was an Oscar's category for stunts and fights, they will take it.

Unfortunately, no amount of ornaments are going to save a movie with a lack of story. The acting here and dialogue delivery is pretty weak... I was also confused with the motivation. I understand Winston and John's friendship but then again, why is he so hell bent on surviving? John hates the trade, he's out then he's in, then he's in with such a goal to survive but for what reason? So then he's back in and wanting to die ...with honour? It seems out of character to want to get people he cares about involved and die for him and he doesn't even know why he wants to live so bad and run from the high table ... then later, he's in the game again to take revenge for his Japanese friend but then doesn't end up avenging him in the end, the guys daughter had to do it herself. Look, I want to say something prolific and sound like a great movie critic but I'm not. So I'm going to just jump in here into the sea of 9s and perfect 10 reviews and hope I can land like John wick after rolling down 20 flights of stairs and not die.

I actually went into micro sleep at the 2hr mark because it was too much action. I know, it's crazy. But I woke up because an old couple had to pass me as they were walking out. They shook their heads, I think they were ready for some quiet tea and snacks.

Hey, you know what peeves me, is that john travels from Osaka to new York then to some other paris and no one kills him on the plane or even the airport? In air, there's no where to go, they would defo be able to kill him in the airplane toilet of even disguise as a hot flight attendant and spike his drink. Also, the blind guy is better than so many other assassins... also, they used the same freaking dog antics as Halle berry but with a black guy that's randomly introduced for fan service or something. Also, i totally saw it coming at the end, as if John will kill Donnie yen. But then they went back to the black guy while he's sitting there drinking beer with his dog and he's like ""that was good/smart"" and I'm like ""whut, no it's nhat"".

And like if you love your dog, you wouldn't be feeding it beer.. hello?

Then also, John fell from buildings and got shot up and is almost immortal. But at the end he just dies from a gunshot wound in his liver with no will to live. He says ""Winston, take me home"", then Winston is like ""yea ok"". But he doesn't even run after him, he just lets John walk down the steps and he dies. But like now he has no will to live? I thought his goal was to live to remember her. If anything, this should've happened in John wick 2, where he gives in after avenging his puppy and getting his car back, then should lie in the sunset to die and reunite with Helen.

Argh but nope he ""dies"". But then the Lionsgate production team realised what a hit this installment was and decides to do a number 5 and 6. So I guess John faked his death and then now comes out of hiding wants to avenge Donnie Yen or the Samurai dude, then they introduce jet li or Jackie Chan and omg it's going to be real Expendables type thing, brainless popcorn flick where everyone just fights real good fight scenes with explosions and falls, fire, snow ice and stuff, lots of injuries, cuts, bloods, 10000 stunt extra deaths, but the main guys limp but still fight with 100% blows and no one dies. Then the ending finally the bad guy has a real dramatic death with flowers and slow music and then John wick is like struggling but saves the day and says ""yeah"".

Ok rant over. Oh well, guess i will watch John wick 5 anyway just to see how bad it is. Lol."
7,"The long-awaited John Wick 4 took a while, but it's finally here. Previous films left the story a little aside to focus much more on the action scenes and with this new release they have taken that even further. The story is simple, it works well, but it's not the main focus. The choreography is wonderful and all the fight scenes are different from the others, which makes them not so tiring. The pace is very frantic and that's wonderful, because it's almost three hours of film. At the beginning it is a little tiring and in fact they could be faster, but the rest is impeccable. Like its predecessors, this is not a masterpiece of cinema, but it works very well as an action film with incredible scenes."
1,"First one was good, 2nd was better and really good. Third was the best, so I thought, it's going the right direction.. I couldn't be more wrong.. First of all, what made the previous movies so great and especially the third one, was the details in the action scenes were so accurate.. All of the sudden in the beginning of the hotel in Japan, John wick kept shooting without reload, until he was alone there doing the shooting..? At the end as well.. 21 bullets in his gun. It seemed more.. Also again in so many movies lately, why exagérating so much and making scenes so long, especially during some dialogues.. You know what they're gonna say or what's coming.. And when he fell down the stairs at the end. That was so over the top and unnecessary and so unrealistic.. He had 8 minutes to climb those 222 steps or so, whilst kicking everybody's ass. 3 minutes to go and down he goes all the way to the bottom and start over, crawl back up, little dialogue with Donnie y'en and make it both in time..?? The director said he had to make movie this long to tell the story. That's not true at all. Story wise, it had no positive effect. He just put in more and longer action scenes.. Total let down when you compare it the previous movies. And very predictable also at some times.. This movie wasnt worth waiting so long and definetly not my money.."
5,It's worth watching for the action and visuals but some scenes seem totally pointless and done just for the visuals. It is the same story of the last of the two movies. Way too long! No action movie should be over two hours. I prefer a film that felt too short. My mind was wondering during fight scenes. Reeves acting is very stale in this one. He is mostly given one word responses to everything. In a three hour movie his dialog is about a paragraph. Nothing really beats the first film. Proving you don't big budgets and flash to make a great film. It is also if fans will appreciate this ending. I didn't care for it but don't want to spoil it for you.
9,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is another great entry in this wonderful series. The franchise has got it's bond beats down in the form of:

1. Meets up with Laurence Fishburne and receives new artillery.

2. The Hit Squad is called and the DJ plays records and narrates the action.

3. John Wick goes through 'mini bosses' to reach the 'big boss'.

4. Insane set pieces which can last for up to 20 minutes.

5. Dog.

This series could last another 10 movies and i would be front and centre every time. John Wick has joined the elite of film franchises which only contain great movies and no duds. Here's to many more."
8,"When I went to watch this movie at the theaters, the first half of the film I felt like I threw away my money, however this quickly changed after I understood why I'm really here.

If you are the one who hasn't seen any of the movies in the franchise, don't expect much. In fact, my friend who hasn't seem any of the movies fell asleep half way.

The friend who has seen a few, said the only thing he liked is the filmography.

Me, on the other hand, during the second part of the movie, understood that I came to watch a movie whose main goal is to blow you away with its incredible fight scenes and effects. And that it does. Don't expect much storytelling or really any story at all, because after watching the movie, it felt like I just watched the 3 series of the franchise again, however with the great action that a Wick movie has to offer.

In all, if you are a hard John Wick fan, you'll be happy with probably the best Wick movie in the franchise, however if you are looking for an interesting script, which will get you close to your screen, don't.

Good film. The above scene is crazy. 8/10."
4,"No idea how the ratings are as high as they are. If you thought the first one was enjoyable but the 3rd one was bull, read on.

Just as the body count in the 3rd was ridiculous, this is even more absurd. Seems after coming up with the bullet proof suit the writers etc thought it a good idea to make sure everyone has one. These giant men sent to kill Wick all wearing suits, raising the jacket to protect their heads was a sight I found so funny. He's the best hitman on the world, how do we kill him? I know, we'll send a blind man!! Pathetic. And he can dodge bullets and he knows where everyone is. You could say it looked choreographed.

Now, about the DJ! They may have well cut the scenes directly from the Warriors. Better film, done better and that isn't a great film. For those of you who have never heard of the Warriors, go watch it. For those of you that have, skip this nonsense."
10,"Okay it's great. Intense amazing action, slick looks, choreography greatness, cool, cool, John Wick is his name and this movie delivers greatness. You gotta see it. John Wick enters the house, bang. John Wick gets angry, bang. John Wick wants to impress, and in this movie he does impress. He wears black suit and uses pistols and he looks great as in the previous movies. Action is amazing, movie looks amazing, John Wick doing stuff is amazing and it's great. Impressive impressive yes indeed. You are in for a treat. John Wick gives us greatness in this movie and it's great so expect to be amazed."
7,"I have always been a huge fan of John Wick movies. The first movie I never saw in the theaters. I saw it on video and then I was hooked. I saw all of the previous John Wick movies in there theaters. I walked out of each one truly entertained and satisfied. For me, a good movie keeps me entertained and guessing what will come next. Sadly to say, this was the first John Wick movie when I said to myself, ""how many gun fights are there,"" in this movie. I actually thought it was a little too much in this last film. The action is non-stop but it all just seemed to be the same thing. Wish there was a little more to the plot. This is not the way I would have ended the franchise."
7,"Just back from an imax viewing. Admittedly not the biggest action fan but this is undoubtedly has some of the best action scenes I've ever seen, the part around the Arc de triomphe especially had me smiling and gasping.

Obviously the whole thing is over the top and far fetched and it's a tough knowing how far to push it with - giving the viewers what they want Vs not being such BS that it's off putting. Well unfortunately with this Caine character I just couldn't get into it, for a blind guy to be doing what he was doing throughout the movie in what was very much a main role was just too ridiculous and ruined the whole movie for me. I can see why it's getting the plaudits it is from fans, but reminded me of that one episode of that 'See' that I watched before I shouted BS and switched it off."
9,"...or is it?

The wife and I went home after watching this on opening night and immediately queued up the first John Wick that kicked everything off. I remarked after the scene when his puppy is killed in that first film ""and this is what started a nonstop body count that ended up somewhere over 1,000 and spanned four films!!"" I think this supplanted the Bond franchise in terms of being more in touch with the kind of 21st century post-Tarantino violence film goers have come to expect from our favorite assassin with a very big chip on his shoulder.

Such a shame to have lost Lance Reddick. Just glad we got to see him on the screen one final time. He and Ian McShane embodied The Continental and brought it to life.

We never once grew bored or weary during the nearly 3-hour runtime. As with each prior film, the action only grew more frenetic and continued unabated from the opening scene. Bill Skarsgard has obviously cornered the market playing creepy baddies, and his Marquis was wonderfully understated yet menacing. Hiroyuki Sanada, Shamier Anderson, Clancy Brown (THE KERGAN!), and Donnie Yen all delivered in their respective roles as erstwhile allies or opponents. We can only hope that there is still more to John Wick and his story!"
10,"The first three JW movies were all gems in their own way. Best Keanu Reeves athleticism and same goes for support actors including the dogs. In JW 3 Hayley Berry and the two outrageous canines nearly stole the whole movie. Having said that with no Keanu there is no John Wick. The succession of bad guys is stunning they are all first class. It was sad to have the wonderful John Reddick pass away in real life which effectively removes a much appreciated support actor as the Continental Hotel Consierge and Ian Mcnees friend. This round of John Wick will be nearly impossible to top in the form of JW 5 if there is to be one. The ending this time does lend itself to a No 5. Drill down you will see that. Again toxic dog input so good. Nearly three hours long but it needs it.

Patrick."
7,"First the good, this has some of the best action scene, chronograph, flow I have ever seen in a movie. Epic doesn't start to explain how good this movie is for action. The seamless flow from one shot, scene and bullet shots is a master piece of cinematic brilliance.

Now the bad, I get the bullet proof clothes, but to be shot repeatedly with no real reaction, too jump out of a third or fourth story window, half land on a car, grunt a few times and run off, really!!!! What made the first one so good was that it could be possible, no superpowers just John Wick being John Wick.

They did bring back some is the minimalist dialog though, the first had just enough, but not to much, and this was the same. 2 and 3 were too..... wordy. Well done acknowledging and adapting to that writers.

An appropriate end to and epic series in a world of very substandard movies of late."
6,"Unlike many other reviewers, i consider the John Wick story diminishing over time.

In the first movie, John Wick was Baba Yaga; the unkillable ghost that everybody had heard of and feared and there was an urgency to everything he did and had to do - from the first kill to the final boss. Every fight scene was meticulous and memorable and we got both high quality and enough quantity.

Over time, and especially in this final chapter of John Wick, almost everything of that is lost. Literally hundreds of assassins sacrifice themselves stupidly on John Wick like they've never heard of him and of course, they all get mowed down like cannon fodder. The fight scenes are no longer meticulous but rather average with repetitive moves, stuntmen waiting to get hit/killed, people entering timely in small groups like it's a video game with increasing difficulty. And to lower the urgency even more, bullets are no longer an issue since they all wear ""bulletproof suits"" that makes bullets bounce off like cotton balls, so now they can shoot A LOT more and it doesn't matter.

John Wick went from no nonsense to lots of nonsense and the director Chad Stahelski made one of the most common mistakes when it comes to movies like this; he sacrificed quality over quantity."
6,"These movies are fine. I find it HILARIOUS when people try to revere them over superhero movies or any other action films. These movies are empty brainless fun action set pieces with AMAZING choreography and beautiful cinematography. But they are NOT high art. It's embarrassing to read the reviews that say otherwise. If you enjoy it more that's great. But Wick falls off three to seven story buildings. He's shot, stabbed, hit by cars!! But he has a bruise and limps so it's super realistic. Not all Batman in a suit with his bulletproof suit.... That isn't knife proof?

John Wick is a live action cartoon that runs on everyone's love for the very cool Keanu Reeves. There's is no heart to these films. There is no emotional anchor. There's is only flash."
